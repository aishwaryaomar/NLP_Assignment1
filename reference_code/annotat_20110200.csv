"You were quick to judge! I was not talking about mobile games either, in fact I wasn't even thinking about mobile games. I strictly game on PC. Anyway, my point was, Bangladesh has not done anything remarkable to get an acknowledgement. So I am not surprised people still doesn't know about us, especially if they are Europeans.

I have been living in Germany for the past 2.5 years. People usually recognizes us with something associated with either Cricket or India or with something bad that we have done (which I am not proud of, I stopped telling people that I am from Bangladesh unless it's necessary, they now assume I am Indian or something). And pretty much 30% - 40% of my teammates never even heard the name when I que matches from here, just like you never heard of that random african country. I wouldn't label it as ignorance to be honest.",0

"\> When you are on a rock bottom it's easy to have a fast growth 

rock bottom? Yeah buddy, we have been in political turmoil for nearly 38 years after independence in 1971 with all of our brainpower effectively killed off just 2 days before war ended, plus famines in 70s which killed nearly 1.5 million and even after all of that, our country just stabilized in early 2010s and since then we have grown consistently in economy (little fact : we tripled our economy within a decade XD), established world class RMG industry just second to China.

We are considered one of the NEXT Eleven countries which are expected to play large roles in 21st century as well expected to become one of the top 25 economies by 2030, considered as the next Asian Tiger, became an emerging middle power country in Indo-Pacific region that every big power is trying to woo.

Since we are at it, your country is also one of the poorest in Europe, so why not compare with Europe instead of us, to feel good about yourselves?",1

"Hey guys Indian here could you please tell reason for Modi protest, is it because we are Hindus and kaafir or because of him being right wing.
Be open I won't feel sad if you call us kafirs or something be real and frank though.

Edit answer to below threads
First of all 2002 was riot.
Search godra kand wherein muslim burned hindu pilgrimage for being kaafirs.
Secondly our stance towards bengal has always been positive, in 2016 we solved our 50 yr old border issue.
Third we are not against bengali people instead we admire you for your growth ,we are even taught how Bangladesh is turning out into manufacturing giant in South Asia.
We are against illigal immigrants.
Fourth if you hate modi because he is right wing, than you would surely hate Erdogan but that's not the case.
So i was curious why there was hate.",1

Isn't it obvious that anyone would want to move to the west because they want a better life and a better income? I'm talking about those people who say they despise the west but want to move there because it's better and then act as if they love everything about it. I'm not sure how you missed this obvious point.,1
