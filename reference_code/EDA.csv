I have emailed their news team with a digest version and linked the Live Reddit thread as well so they could see it for themselves.

If anyone else is up for the task, blow up Sky's team to pressure to report on this.

Plus, blow up your own country's news teams so they would feel some pressure to get on top of this .

"Slacktivism, social media exposure and online petitions are not going to help you in any way. It will just foster the illusion of having done something and fill us with a sense of self righteousness. Directly contacting politicians at this stage will only result in apathy without having gained a platform for these incidents on mainstream media first.

You need to contact the South Asian news desks for all the MSM outlets. It needs to gain traction with local reporters and go up the ladder for the respective agencies before they splash it all over their main pages.

Reuters, AFP, BBC, Al-J and the like all have regional subdivisions with local reporters...it’s them who need to be tweeted at, not the organisation at the top level.

Also try non traditional media. These events are bread and butter for the folks behind Vice News, Daily Show, John Oliver, Samantha Bee, Jim Jeffries, The Last Leg with Adam Hills and other socially conscious satirists of their ilk. They may help give you more exposure.

You need momentum in the media before any external politician or political organisation will step up and say anything. Before even talking about the UN or EU, you have your SAARC, GCC and ASEAN closer by who may be persuaded to say something first.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—

"Two students died in a bus race that had nothing to do with the government. The government can make regulations (which is certainly lacking) but abiding to it is on drivers. Both drivers were arrested. The roads are bad because ex PM Khaleda Zia and her son siphoned off trillions of Taka. During her 5 year tenure in 01-06 Bangladesh was number 1 in whole world in corruption for 5 straight years.

The agitation was made violent as soon as Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chatra Dal the student wing of Khaleda Zia's BNP joined. JCD has a history of violence and murder not only amongst its faction but is generally a radical Islam supporter and  supported the many killings of secular bloggers and vloggers in Bangladesh. BNP itself is a rabid anti secular party and very very religious. Khaleda follows the footsteps of her dictator husband. Don't forget Jamaat-e-islami a nefarious hardcore Islamic political party who does not believe in secularism. It's student wing is known for bomb attacks and machete killings. It has also committed war crimes during Bangladesh independence fight of 1971. It's leader once boasted of killing 1000 Biharis by himself in a single day. It's student wing Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir supports shariat and supports only madrassa education. In February 2014, US-based defense think tank IHS Jane's published a report titled ""IHS Jane's 2013 Global Terrorism & Insurgency Attack Index"", where Shibir(Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir) ranked third in a list of most active non-state armed groups in 2013.

Every minister has urged students to either go back to classes or be in home. Do accidents not happen in any other part of the world? Bangladesh has a good judicial system. Grievances could have been directed there. It's not like bangladesh is a rich country with surplus budget. 

This agitation is nothing more than a ploy by opposition to sway the democratic election which are to be held later this year. It's politics on dead bodies(*Laash pe rajneeti karna*). The BNP and Jamaat both supported terrorist and militancy in India supporting the ULFA, NSCN (I-M), PLA and other Manipuri outfits found a safe haven in Bangladesh not only morally but financing and giving them living quarters after attack on India.

According to the Saudi authorities, Khaleda Zia and her sons had an investment of around $12 billion in malls and other infrastructural projects in Saudi Arabia with the money amassed through bribery and extortion. As investigations are underway, more facts have surfaced about huge investments by the BNP chief's late son Arafat alias Koko, who died in January 2015. Koko allegedly made enormous investments in Saudi Arabia - all from ill-gotten wealth. He was also wanted in Bangladesh for multiple charges of corruption. Similarly, his brother Tareq Rahman, now in hiding in England, invested several millions of dollars in many foreign destinations with a large chunk of sum in Saudi Arabia and other West Asian countries. Earlier, there were allegations, many supported by evidence, that Tareq had nefarious dealings, including money-laundering and large investments, with the underworld dons, detrimental to Indian security interests.

"Hey! I too also live in the United States but am a concerned Bangladeshi. 

Basically a week ago two school bus drivers in Bangladesh were racing against each other to pick up their passengers. In their race they ended up killing two students. This already sparked outrage at the lack of people that follow the traffic laws; but insensitive comments from our shipping minister Shajahan Khan who is also president of the Road Transport Federation fueled the fire and millions of students took to the streets to protest for the past week. 

The protests were peaceful and there was no intention of violence. These kids were educating drivers on the streets on traffic law, checking if drivers had their licenses, creating lanes for different vehicles, etc. Doing things that our government should have done years ago. Instead of fixing the problem, the government (currently ruled by the Awami League) retaliated yesterday by firing rubber bullets and tear gas at the students. Hundred of terrified girls were kept hostage by the government and police in buildings they took refuge in. Four students died and four girls were allegedly raped. Hundreds more injured, and some aren’t even able to get treated now because the government has threatened retaliation against the doctors/nurses. 

A lot have now took to social media to share pictures and videos as an outcry for help. The Bangladeshi government is censoring everything on the local news and Facebook and YouTube are taking down anything related to the events. The Bangladeshi government have also recently taken away mobile internet in an attempt to hide what they are calling “fake news”. 

And all this because some kids wanted to help people follow traffic laws to make Bangladesh a better place.",164,t1_e3nl1y9,3,0,2018-08-05 17:37:05

">Where is the iPhone client? Terrible idea.

Blame Apple for not wanting an actually secure mesh messaging system on their platform. :)

It definitely ISN'T a terrible idea to use a more secure client between Android phones and avoid using FireChat as much as it makes sense, but no further. I didn't say to ignore it entirely. My point: Briar ought to get a lot more encouragement than FireChat and that people who point out FireChat should also point out the security risks associated with it, and to neglect doing so seems like an actually terrible idea.

>still holds true for other FOSS applications.

1. You likely didn't intend it, but the way you wrote that sentence, it implies that FireChat is FOSS (Free Open Source Software). It's not, it is proprietary software, Briar is not.

2. Let me go over the issues addressed in the article one by one:

>>However, an individual within one of the mesh networks could easily snoop on nearby users' discussions because all conversations are conducted in open chatrooms.

This doesn't hold true for Briar, Mesh network traffic is already encrypted.

>What's more, the app does not facilitate private, one-to-one messaging and also doesn't use any kind of encryption to protect messages in transmission. 

This doesn't hold true for Briar, everything is encrypted.

>It doesn't change anything, the governemnt can access them as well. 
That sounds like [FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt). The government almost certainly CAN'T access anything written via Briar.

>Assuming Google will not sentence many people to death

...seriously? Wind down your hyperdramatic rhetoric a bit, please.

Assuming Google will not sentence many people to death, it's an absolutely terrible idea to switch to something that doesn't work on both Android and iOS.

>it's an absolutely terrible idea to switch to something that doesn't work on both Android and iOS.

"**Mesh networking**

A mesh network (or simply Meshnet) is a local network topology in which the infrastructure nodes (i.e. bridges, switches and other infrastructure devices) connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data from/to clients. This lack of dependency on one node allows for every node to participate in the relay of information. Mesh networks dynamically self-organize and self-configure, which can reduce installation overhead.

"**Fear, uncertainty and doubt**

Fear, uncertainty and doubt (often shortened to FUD) is a disinformation strategy used in sales, marketing, public relations, politics, cults, and propaganda. FUD is generally a strategy to influence perception by disseminating negative and dubious or false information and a manifestation of the appeal to fear.

While the phrase dates to at least the early 20th century, the present common usage of disinformation related to software, hardware and technology industries generally appeared in the 1970s to describe disinformation in the computer hardware industry, and has since been used more broadly.

"Telegram does not use End to End encryption as a standard - you have to manually start it by using the private chat function. The transport laEr encryption used for regular messages cannot be trusted if you control a large enough part of the connection process. Many users are not aware of this problem.        
Furthermore the encryption algorithm itself is not thoroughly known. We know from German and British law enforcement files that at least their respective agencies were able to hack it.           
Last but not least Telegram can be completly ""taken over"" by a so called BGP attack, although for a limited time only- which was done recently by Iran. (See here for the BGP hack:  https://www.cyberscoop.com/telegram-iran-bgp-hijacking/) ",4,t1_e3nld5t,4,0,2018-08-05 20:00:53

2) Not *every* Pakistani has an ancestor who committed these war crimes. That doesn’t mean every Pakistani is innocent, only that you should limit your criticism to the actual perpetrators and their families, not every *single* citizen who ever walked beneath the Pakistani flag. Otherwise it becomes one of those unproductive “You Jews killed our Jesus!” blaming games that only alienate further

3) My point was also that it doesn’t even *matter* whether war crimes were committed or not in this specific context, since Bengali students today are completely removed from the wartime sins of the ‘70s, and ergo should be dealt with as an entirely separate humanitarian crisis

They've seen pooping since the day of their birth. So many of this region's problems seem to be the result of longstanding traditions. Can we expect this to change soon? If your home has no plumbing, what else can one do other than walk to a private location and dig a hole?

> They lock rape victims in prison for protection from honor killings by family for being raped.

It certainly seems they're handling this problem backwards. On the other hand, maybe protecting that victim is the only way to prevent a village of enraged locals coming after the police building with the crude weapons of the area.

Everybody must have heard of [the school burnings just a few days ago coming from Pakistan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-blast-schools/twelve-schools-bombed-burned-in-northern-pakistan-idUSKBN1KO1TV), which is in the same geographic area.  It may drive a person to believe that the whole region is simply screwed.

However..... to narrow down to the question of the existence of rational thought in that region... Doesn't it seem rather *irrational* to suggest that it is non-existent? Might it not seem more reasonable to consider rational thought as the commodity of the educationally rich... and that educational disparity is the relevant issue?

In other words, how to increase and protect education in that area? Seems this is the only way those people will free themselves of the culture and traditions that are clearly holding them back.",6,t1_e3o6nei,1,-1,2018-08-06 00:37:03

"It looks like people are using their real names to upload photos, which is dangerous. There are a lot of other ways you can be identified, as well. Any device connecting to the internet has an ""IP address"" that websites can (and almost always) record, **and show your physical location**. (As specific as a ~~neighborhood~~ city block!) Further, your internet provider knows every website you use. Corrupt governments can and will find dissidents this way. Complete safety is impossible, but there are tools the minimize *some* risks. I don't know what kinds of devices people are using, but I'll try to cover the most common operating systems.

My **NON-EXPERT** advice:

The Tor browser is a great, free tool, for just this purpose. If you can't use Tor, there's the ProtonVPN program for Windows and MacOS, which you can use with any browser. It's a little harder to use on phones, because it doesn't have native apps yet, while Tor is available on Android ([Orbot plus Orfox](https://guardianproject.info/releases/)) but not iOS. ProtonVPN has a free tier, which is slow but secure - don't trust any VPN that has no paid tiers. Tor and VPNs encrypt information leaving your computer and pass it through one or more servers around the world, so that websites don't know what device you're browsing from, and the internet company doesn't know what website you're using. For the Tor Browser, use the ""[Bridges](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en)"" mode, so that you won't be identified as a TOR user. For VPNs, be sure to turn the ""start with [OS],"" ""auto connect,"" and ""kill switch"" options on, to minimize risk of accidentally exposing yourself.

One good things about the Tor Browser is that it can be run off of a flash drive, so you can use any computer. It's also standardized and has security settings defaulted so that it's more difficult to ""fingerprint."" If using a VPN, I recommend a new browser and settings/extensions shown [here](https://operational-security.com/3dsc-2-8-adjust-firefox-settings-security/) and [here](https://operational-security.com/firefox-security-privacy-add-ons/), to limit history/cookie collection, in case your computer is taken by police.

Only log into one service at a time, so that you can't be identified by cookies or cross-referencing accounts accessed. If using a VPN and a browser with container tabs, use container tabs if you need to log into multiple services simultaneously. Use a different username (unrelated to your identity/interests/biography - it can even be random, like mine) for each service (a password manager helps with this - keepass is free and there are versions for all operating systems), and don't give any real information when creating an account.

[Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) is a privacy-respecting email service that you can sign up for with just a username and password, though you can't send or receive emails for 48 hours, if you trip their spam detection algorithm. [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) is a better email provider overall, but requires sms or email confirmation that you're a real person, which would be a problem if your text messages or emails are already being spied on and you can't create a Tutanota account or use an internet based phone number.

Many news organizations use a tool called Secure Drop for uploading things. I don't know much about it, but by all means, use it - it's probably one of the best things you can do, **especially if you have photographs or videos that identify perpetrators of violence**. Thank you to the brave people who brought the protests to out attention, but please go to journalists first, not social media. Tell them everything you can in both English and Bengali - the basic information in English will let them work quickly and they'll find a translator to get the details from the Bengali. Links to news organization tips pages at the bottom - they all have instructions.

For communication within protest groups, ProtonMail is the best encrypted email and [Wire](https://wire.com/) is the best encrypted chat app. [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) uses phone numbers as usernames, which makes networking easier but may identify you. [Sudo](https://sudoapp.com/) (iOS only) gives you nine internet-based phone numbers and email addresses, which would be very difficult for the government to identify. Communication within the Sudo network is encrypted, but a few people downloading it and using the phone numbers and email addresses to create ProtonMail or Wire accounts for other protesters is perhaps a better use, since it's only for iOS. You can get three more identities per device with MySudo (the company is transitioning), but that app comes with very little call time.

Do **NOT** use WhatsApp. Backups aren't encrypted and are on by default and it's owned by facebook, has poor account security and a history of cooperating with oppressive regimes. A lot of news organizations offer to communicate through WhatsApp, but I think that that's because it's popular, not because it's good.

Metadata - sender/recipient and subject lines - isn't usually encrypted within apps, only the messages themselves, so a VPN is important. **Networks can be brought down by identifying who's messaging whom, even if the messages are unreadable**. This is usually done a more powerful government over a long period of time, but know that metadata is powerful - the US kills terrorists based on metadata. Journalists should be removing metadata (type of camera/phone, time, possibly location, etc.) from photos they use, but do it yourself before uploading them, anyway. You should be able to do so from your computer's file browser by right clicking properties>security or the equivalent.

If you need to secure photos/video to share with journalists later, email them to yourself rather than uploading them to social media. Even if they're not cooperating with the government, social media sites can and will delete violent content, just as a matter of policy. **Evidence of war crimes has been lost this way.** For larger files, sync.com is a cloud storage site with 5 gb free that is *probably* safe, but hasn't been audited for security like Tutanota, ProtonMail, Signal, and Wire and isn't old enough to have a track record. They don't ask for much information, and you should be connecting through Tor of a VPN, so there shouldn't be much that could go wrong with sync, anyway. You can use encrypted zip files both for an added layer of security and to reduce upload/download times, though you would need to either skip the encryption or communicate a password when sending the files, of course.

I think all smartphones have full disc encryption as an option in the security settings. Use it, along with a [long passcode](https://operational-security.com/ios-full-disk-encryption/), if you have a smartphone. Disable location tracking and turn it off, whenever you don't need it on and are at a protest. If a police officer takes your phone while it's unlocked, they'll still get everything, but if you're arrested with it locked, it'll be potentially impossible for them to get inside, without you unlocking it. (That said, they could threaten/torture you; you may just be delaying the inevitable.) Computers can be more difficult. It would be easier to use Bleachbit or CCleaner to overwrite anything sensitive immediately after it's been uploaded to the cloud/journalists.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a [Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/) guide with more information. [Motherboard.Vice.com](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a37m4g/the-motherboard-guide-to-avoiding-state-surveillance-privacy-guide), as well. [The Paranoid's Bible](https://paranoidsbible.tumblr.com/post/160173700334/the-paranoids-bible-20) wasn't written with this in mind, but is also good.

ProtonMail uses the same PGP encryption that the EFF recommends, and, [as of last week](https://protonmail.com/blog/address-verification-pgp-support/), can work with out-of-network PGP tools. You also access it completely through an internet browser, so your emails are on a server in Switzerland, rather than your hard drive. Fewer potential points of failure, and you don't need to download anything to your computer for police to find. To send a PGP encrypted email from ProtonMail to a newspaper or journalist, add them to your contacts; [there will be an option to upload their public key](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/how-to-use-pgp/). With other PGP tools, you either need to install a browser extension and link it to your email account or download Thunderbird and link that, plus a plugin - I think this is a big improvement.

Good luck, everyone! Again, I'm not an ""operational security"" expert, and even if I was, **nothing can eliminate risk in a situation like this**, but this is better than uploading to reddit with your real name, from your regular browser. /r/privacy will try to help you with any questions.

"There has not been a lot of news coverage here in America and I hope that we can all bring more awareness to what is currently occurring on the other side of the world. I compiled a list of what has happened and some links to more information. If anything is wrong just let me know and I’ll get to it when I can. This is by no means a complete list, just a broad overview of what is happening.

Currently, the Bangladesh government is trying to squash people's attempts to speak out against the violence that is occurring under the pretense of stopping ""fake news"" from spreading. To give you context of the situation at hand, two school bus drivers were recklessly racing one another to pick up passengers and led to the killing of two students. This resulted in public outrage and protest that was greatly fueled by comments made by Shajahan Khan, President of the Road Transport Federation. What started off as a peaceful, student movement against the killing of two students and road safety, has ended in bloodshed and violence. Several attacks are being made on students and journalists allegedly from the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), a corrupt youth organization linked to the Awami League.

I understand a lot of this is fairly recent and it's hard to pinpoint the truth in some of claims being made in the social media chaos that is ensuing, but the amount of evidence (photos, videos,articles) that is fitting the civilian’s narrative better than the governments is outstanding (see links below).

We cannot let a corrupt system take advantage over these people. We need to let as many people know the terrifying reality that is occurring right now. It is a warning to all of us of what can occur when the wrong people have too much power. As of now, the government has made attempts to cut off mobile internet, stop news outlets from reporting on the incidents, and change the narrative so it would fall in their favor.",14,t3_94a5wd,0,0,2018-08-05 22:34:47

"I don't support alot of movements. I could've been supporting the situation in the Middle East, or the crisis in Venezuela. But I'm currently not. So why am I supporting this particular protest? Because of alot of reasons, most of which are the blatant violations of human rights (which is a huge point of the protest). But the main reason for me is censorship. And I HATE censorship. I hate being silenced and having my voice muted. Their government is taking down media and posts that were supposed to spread the untarnished truth of their grim situation. This makes it more important than ever to speak out. A government that causes problems and subsequently hides those problems, is an inhumane government. Some might argue that sharing on social media or signing some petition would just be ineffective slacktivism. But it's that attitude that suppresses the message from reaching the attention of both the masses and the international authority. We need two things from the world: their undivided attention, and their undying support. The second part should be easy as what is shown is obviously and undeniably wrong. But we haven't finished the first step yet. And hitting that share button or that ""sign this petition"" button might do just that, if enough people do it.

I am making 2 points. That the government of Bangladesh is a horrible one. And that one should not think that they cannot do anything that makes a difference. Speak out. Let the world be able to watch with understanding eyes. ",24,t3_94a5wd,0,-1,2018-08-06 02:39:13

"Is my understanding of the situation correct?

About a week ago students started protesting the government giving bus drivers licenses that didn’t deserve them, or were under age, therefore making the roads unsafe. The protest we’re sparked because two high school students were killed by buses. And then I believe four women were raped? And now protesters are being shot out with live rounds despite being peaceful/checking licenses. The Internet has also been shut off for most of the country. 

I’m trying to get the full story, but all of the news articles appear to be several days old and don’t include any of the police retaliation. 

Edit: I believe there was also a text message that went  out to everyone in the country stating that reports of killing/ rape were falsified and anyone spreading rumors should be reported to the government. ",8,t3_94a5wd,0,-1,2018-08-05 02:19:30

What made matters worse was that he had 'smiles that would not go away', according to an article in the Dhaka Tribune.""

V: We were first attacked at Jigatola where 4 girls were directly raped. \[He repeats this several times, and the reporter asks him to confirm several times, as if in disbelief. R: Where are they now? V: They've disappeared. R: Okay, so we've heard that someone died right on the spot? V: \[nods\] We've received information that 4 people were shot and one of them- R: Were the police using rubber bullets? V: Not rubber bullets, live ammunition. Rubber bullets don't penetrate. They only leave bruises. R: Okay, what is BGB \[Bangladesh Border Guard, a law-enforcement agency\] doing there? What is their stance? V: BGB has closed its gates. R: BGB closed its gates? Okay, are the general students still protesting there? \[At Jigatola\] V: Yes, and the students are in front of Popular Hospital. \[A nearby clinic.\] And Chatro League \[the student wing of armed men responsible for these attacks\] is right on the other side. R: Where are the Chatro League members? V: Jigatola bus stand. R: They took up positions in Jigatola bus stand? V: On all sides. Chatro League has surrounded the place, leaving us stranded in the middle. R: Have you had any contact with any key leaders of Chatro League since the morning? V: They're good. They're probably sitting in an air-conditioned room, watching TV while students are dying and they're laughing at the whole thing. R: Okay so if you have indeed spoken to them- V: We've had no contact with them so far. R: So you've never even had any communication with them? They didn't stop even once, and instead started attacking you? V: They did not stop. They simply attacked. R: Did you manage to identify them? Like who is attacking, and where they're from? Did any media outlets reach out? Do you have an estimate on the number of injured students? V: Over ten. Over ten were injured and four were shot, one of whom died immediately. Four girls were raped. R: The four girls you claim were raped, are they students of your college as well? V: No, they're from Rifles College.

"You don't have to look at what triggered the event, but at the whole history of the country. The fact that the public transports there can run over people without any consequence -- which is already fucked up by itself -- is probably only one amongst many other issues they face.

A couple years ago a bunch of protests happened in Brazil against the Government's corruption and bad admnistration and what triggered the event was a raise of 20 cents in the bus money. Some people tried to demoralize the cause by saying things like ""it's just 20 cents"", but that overly simplistic explanation didn't take into account that it was like the 3rd ""small"" raise in a very short amount of time and that there were a lot of recent cases of corruption in all sectors. It wasn't only about 20 cents, but it was what triggered the event. Nowadays Brazil is much better and a lot of important politics were sent to the jail for corruption, including the highly popular ex-president.

3) People protest in demand for more strict traffic laws.

4) Minister in charge of transportation with known ties to POWERFUL CORRUPT TRANSPORT UNIONS makes insensitive remarks and brushes off the issue despite massive protest.

5) Public demands for his resignation.

6) Police start shooting rubber bullets and armed gangs show up beating and sometimes even murdering students with machetes.

"Kazakhstan's currency is called the 'Tenge', and apparently it's meaning is related to scales (like balancing scale). The Tajiks apparently say it like _tanga_, and the word originates from Mongolic. I wonder if that might be related to our Taka.

This is what I got from Wikipedia:

>The word tenge in Kazakh and in most other Turkic languages means a set of scales (cf the old Uzbek tenga or the Tajik borrowed term tanga). The origin of the word is the Mongolic word teng (ᠲᠡᠩ) which means ""being equal, balance"". The name of this currency is thus similar to the pound, lira, peso, taka, and shekel. The name of the currency is related to the Russian word for money Russian: деньги/ den'gi, which the Old Russian language borrowed from Turkic sources.",8,t1_hklz32k,1,0,2021-11-15 02:36:54

"On the 29th of July, two bus drivers were racing to pick up passengers and killed two students who were waiting for a bus. Since then, high school and college students took to the streets and have been protesting peacefully against dangerous road conditions (i.e. no driving and traffic regulations and poor enforcement). They took it upon themselves to manage traffic (creating emergency lanes; arranging them according to vehicle size) and checking licenses of every passing vehicle (including police vehicles) on major roads. 

There are several students now dead and missing; all they did was demand safer roads in a country where people die from road accidents every single day. They took to the streets and checked licenses, regulated traffic, exposed an incredible number of people including government and ministry workers for driving without valid licenses. They had been doing a better job than traffic regulation and law enforcement officers in the city, and all they wanted was an assurance of safety.

This protest was entirely peaceful, wholesome and supported by most citizens. The government’s reaction to this was to send out student political parties to also don school uniforms and partake in the demonstrations. These “students” infiltrated the protests and initiated violence both on the students and public property, followed by law enforcement doing the same: opening fire and using anti-riot equipment such as tear gas, aimed at protesters who were 13-20 years old.

This event has gained traction on international media recently, and has been covered by multiple media outlets such as the New York Times and BBC. However, they’ve stated multiple times that the government claims these were instigated by the opposing party, while other parties have been trying to twist the narrative to fit their own agendas. However, that is NOT true. These are young students protesting PEACEFULLY against law-breakers and unsafe roads, they have no political affiliations whatsoever.

The government has also shut down mobile data in the country and slowed down internet speeds. They have been arresting and detaining people for posting things online that implied dissent, and multiple journalists have been attacked, detained and had their recording equipment seized and destroyed. The media was made to withdraw many of their previous statements and say their sources were wrong, and some hospitals are being pressured into turning away students who were injured at the protests. 

Today, Bangladesh is a battleground. These ""student politicians"" have turned the streets into a hunting ground, chasing down these peaceful protesters and brutalizing them. They're literally hunting anyone that looks like a student and murdering and mauling in the most inhuman ways... And these monsters are supported by the government. Law enforcement and these thugs (who are all armed beyond their pay grade) have murdered multiple people already, committed other crimes like rape and also attacking those trying to help the children.

"The same thing that had been happening for years all across the globe.

1. General population (en masse, not a few individuals) stops recognizing government as the legitimate authority - in general, or on some specific matter.

2. Status quo comes under threat. Examples need to be made.

3. Right-wing ""militia"" (as a rule, gangsters of some kind - though, sometimes some or all *are* on government's payroll) gets mobilized and responds with deliberately public terror tactics: beatings, tortures, rapes, murders, etc.

	Basically, you lose any and all rights as a human if you challenge status quo (or, if you *look* like challenging it, since nobody actually checks - there is quite a lot of violence done for other reasons, but framed as political). As a rule, police/judiciary will not even pretend that they care, though they might attempt to arrest and persecute those who resist this open terrorism.

	All of this is made painfully known to general population. All is presented as the new norm the society lives under.

4. Response gets hijacked by politicians, who try to keep resistance within ""politically correct"" boundaries until it loses momentum and everything can go back as it was before (only with more crime, corruption, and violence).

5. The rest of the world pretends that there was some kind of ""controversy"" and drowns out any discussions with meaningless jabber.",65,t3_94rgz9,0,0,2018-08-05 15:04:18

"Hello, I'm a Bangladeshi citizen living in Dhaka and a long time lurker, made an account so I could comment on the situation.

First of all, thank you for summarizing and highlighting the situation. However, there's some fake images, videos and descriptions are being heavily circulated which might lessen the impact of the actual things that are happening, specially in the world media.

Over the course of the last two days, the BCL members and other hired thugs attacked the student protesters and mercilessly beat them with steel rods, sticks and used machetes while the Dhaka Metropolitan Police either assisted them by hurling tear shells or stood around doing nothing. More than 150 students have been injured, some of them severely so, and most of them are getting treated in various hospitals. Again 20 to 25 journalists were   also brutally beat up by the same attackers. Students were also beaten up in the last few days. The editor(Who Is a woman) of a weekly magazine published by our nation's most widely circulated English Daily, The Daily Star, was beaten, dragged across the street and molested until she agreed to delete the footage featuring the BCL men committing atrocities. The condition here is truly horrible, but, a lot of people, specially on reddit are overstating various issues which might end up undermining the noble purpose and objective of the safe road protests.

For starters, while 3G and 4G internet services were shut down yesterday, they're back up now and most of the major and legit news outlets are reporting pretty much everything. And there's been no proof or validity of any of the rape and murder allegations that have surfaced so far. In fact, they've been disproved by trust-worthy news outlets such as The Daily Star and Dhaka Tribune. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not straight up saying they're untrue, and BCL members have been involved with many sexual assaults in the past, but none of the accounts in this case add up.A large number of female students are not missing and no dead bodies have been found on the spot where the clash occurred.

I'm only sincerely asking you to fact-check everything you're sharing. Because there truly are government sanctioned attacks being launched by BCL, and in our current situation, we can't hold the PM accountable, and she's resorted to the tactic of dismissing everything as rumours. If fake news clouds the legitimate reports then I fear this rhetoric of the government might work. There's things happening that are truly terrible enough to grab the attention of the international media. For example, the police and BCL members are practically pouncing on the students of a University right now. That's why, once again, I implore you as a Bangladeshi to only share and circulate things that are definitely true.",10,t1_e3n7pxd,1,0,2018-08-06 09:19:01

"> Right-wing ""militia"" (as a rule, gangsters of some kind - though, sometimes some or all are on government's payroll) 

Addendum: this is not a right-wing trait. It's an authoritarian trait. 

I'm just learning of the situation in Bangladesh and it honestly hurts how much it sounds like the June Journeys protests of 2013 in Brazil, protests I attended and have had friends hospitalized, beaten or arrested over. 

The chain of events was the same as you and the current top comment describe (including and especially the part about the ""student politicians"" on party payroll who infiltrate schools and student movements, which hurts a lot to see), except then (and now, though they're no longer in power) the militias infiltrating protests to start fights and vandalize property destroying the peaceful movement, as well as the brutal police that was ordered to escalate the violence and delegitimize the demands were all commanded by the *left*, the then ruling Labor Party and its allied base, consisting mostly of all the communist and socialist-leaning parties.

I'm not saying if the right rises to power things will be better or different, on the contrary the Brazilian conservative right scares me shitless, but for the same reason the conservative left does. 

So what I'm doing here is urging you and everyone else not to bring idealism into this and see it for what it is: **authoritarianism always hurts the people.** Left or right. 

I will read and learn more about the situation in Bangladesh before I form a proper opinion, but regardless it is my firm belief that power must rest in the hands of the people, and any government who will use force against its own citizens should not be. I do not think our Journeys of June were for nothing, they're an event Brazilian millennials and post-millennials imprinted firmly in our history and that will remain forever, and those troubled times have changed the course of history for my country. We're still undergoing the subsequent crisis, but the hope has remained, and Brazilians have seen that we can and should stand up against the corrupt rulers, and we made them see that too. I hope with all my strength that the same can happen in Bangladesh, and that your people can rise beyond the turmoil and enact change.

A mild inconvenience exposed and ticketed so many people driving who weren't qualified to drive, a lot of which are supposed to be people helping keep the country safe. Normally you can just bribe the cop who catches you without a license and you're free to go without being g reported. 


Protests aren't successful unless they gain attention. Peaceful protests are non-violent protests. You can't have a successful protest in a system that doesn't give a shit by being passive. Instead they took over the government's job and did it better, protected its citizens better.

Americans have a grown fear of authoritarian governments. This likely stems from the independence war after the shitty ruling by the British and further proliferated by WW2, the Cold War, Vietnam, our history with the Korean penninsuila, and our shaky relations with the Chinese.

"> Addendum: this is not a right-wing trait. It's an authoritarian trait.

If you disagree with someone, you should explain why you do not agree. Not try to make it seem as if this someone agrees with you.

&nbsp;

I am not saying ""right-wing militia"" because it sounds fancy, but because that's what it is.

""Authoritarian"" interpretation implies that it is a quality of state. As I mentioned already, there are plenty of examples of private individuals (i.e. unaffiliated with state) participating in violence. Hence, any attempts to simply disempower state - i.e. act upon ""authoritarian understanding"", which implies reducing state power - will inevitably backfire: you are not removing the source of the problem. It's not about state.

> commanded by the left, the then ruling Labor Party and its allied base, consisting mostly of all the communist and socialist-leaning parties.

You can obviously call everyone you don't like left or even communist. Nobody can deny you that. However, you should also keep in mind that words which do not correspond to reality do not have any meaning.

Like in this specific case when you ended up with supposed ""communists"" defending interests of the rich.

> So what I'm doing here is urging you and everyone else not to bring idealism into this and see it for what it is: authoritarianism always hurts the people. Left or right.

In the same year (2013), Ukraine attempted to do exactly what you preach here. People rejected division between left and right, people had joined their forces against the ""authoritarian"" regime - and by 2014 they were victorious: state power disintegrated into nothingness, police troops were publicly beaten and shamed, ""authoritarianism"" was done away with in the most conclusive manner.

Except when you had people being beaten by policemen, you got public mass-murders - Odessa massacre alone had over 40 people dead, and even more died later (not only many were horribly burned and badly wounded from beatings, survivors were also denied basic healthcare). And after gangs of ""anti-authoritarian"" activists attempted to ""rape into submission"" whole regions, the result was low-key civil war with tens of thousands dying. 

The only ones who benefited were the very same corrupt state officials who were supposed to be deposed and the rich men who were milking Ukraine before.

&nbsp;

P.s. and I would like to also make prediction that the same thing will happen in Venezuela, once supposedly ""extremely left-wing"" government will give way and fall before freedom-loving ""anti-authoritarians"", just as it did in Chile - when ""totalitarian dictatorship"" of Allende was done away with.",-1,t1_e3nohxd,2,0,2018-08-05 20:14:14

> It is also a very different set of events, with ethnic and nationality considerations and heavy foreign interference, and really doesn't apply here at all.

No, it applies perfectly.

It was not about ""ethnic or nationality considerations"". Original protesters (pro-Maidan) did not present any ethnic/national demands. Their intent was to combat corruption and authoritarianism. That was it. Except they also embraced support of the rich (no reason not to, they are anti-authoritarian, after all) in their crusade and had their movement hijacked - which is how, once the old government had fallen, Maidan leaders redefined Maidan movement along more acceptable lines (which did not infringe upon their interests; nationalist, rather than economic) and most of corrupt officials stayed where they were before (with new and even more corrupt officials replacing those who got kicked out).

This pattern repeats in other situations, except nationalism gets replaced with other ""hot"" issues. For example, in Egypt (2011) it was religion. Hardly anyone would say that ""Revolution of Dignity"" (the same words Maidan propaganda used, btw) was about Islam, but it was the Muslim Brotherhood who ended up in charge.

"You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.",0,t1_e3nmxg1,2,-1,2018-08-05 17:44:31
"Yeah I consider them violent, and anyone else who blocks a road in protest. 

You say ""make it violent by running people over"" and I agree that would be escalating the situation and causing much greater violence. But is there no culpability for the person who created the situation where someones options are either run the dude over or do what he wants? 

I think there should be, I think if you create that situation or any other situation where you try to extort someone with their own aversion to hurting you that you are responsible for the consequences. ",2,t1_e3nmsru,2,-1,2018-08-05 17:51:39
Under every definition I can find using your body to control some else's counts as violence but I'd be happy to hear why you think that's not the case. ,1,t1_e3nim2c,2,-1,2018-08-05 16:38:26
"You could look at it that way or just see the person blocking you as making a more nuanced demand: do what I want or find another route. 

If you look at it that way I still think there's a problem with it and it still counts as violence. ",0,t1_e3ni8cw,2,0,2018-08-05 17:41:38
"You couldn't block a road if you were a disembodied voice, or not solid matter like Kitty from X men.

"I don't agree with that, to be honest. There are plenty of non-violent reasons for not letting me pass a street or a carnival. Would you feel violated if a cop doesn't let you pass a street because it is closed for some reason? Or a bank, because it just closed? Is it violence if there is any other way to get what you want anyway (i.e. take another way, get stuff at other places). How long would somebody have to stand in your way so it turns violent?
And from the other side, if we just call everything violent now, it degrades the act of calling attention to issues in a peaceful way. At least if it contains me being angry about not walking the exact way I planned out some time beforehand.",2,t1_e3nnmtq,3,-1,2018-08-05 18:06:58

"behavior involving physical force INTENDED to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something. And the only thing the kids are wanting to hurt, damage and/or kill are the shitty traffic laws and regulations that are look at as normality in their country.",4,t1_e3nixe9,3,-1,2018-08-05 17:08:13
"Unless the people blocking the road physically attack you, it is not violence. Blocking traffic does not cause you physical harm. Asking to see your license does not cause you physical harm. If they start trying to attack you with a crowbar or something, *that* can cause physical harm and is considered violence. 

You don't get to redefine words just because you are inconvenienced.",3,t1_e3nzqir,3,-1,2018-08-06 01:05:43
"Your examples are muddying the waters since they are so different than the circumstances we originally started talking about. 

There's nuance to every situation you described that makes it distinct from protests stopping people from getting where they want to go. We as society give cops the authority to detain people and block roads. Banks are  businesses which have operating hours that apply to everyone. 

We're not talking about making you walk a slightly different way around someone. We're talking about protests that block roads or entry into buildings. I don't think alternative routes or alternative venues are relevant, the issue is one person's decision to impose his will on another through physical force. ",1,t1_e3nob4y,4,-1,2018-08-05 18:30:27
"You can't say they didn't intend to impede innocent people in pursuit of their goal though. 

That's the whole point of blocking a road. ",1,t1_e3nkqy0,4,-1,2018-08-05 17:36:34
"So. Let me get this straight. It’s okay to have atrocious traffic law that cost “innocent” lives everyday but it’s not okay to “impede innocent people” to make sure they at least have, let’s just say “proper drivers license”?? This is how things get changed. This is what needs to be done when the government you have is all family related. Their internet is out dude. Look at the bigger picture!!",3,t1_e3nmga5,5,-1,2018-08-05 17:46:21
"None of what you mentioned has any bearing on whether or not it's accurate to describe the actions of protestors as violent or peaceful. 

You can act violently for a good cause. You can act peacefully for a good cause. You can be justified in using violence for a good cause. You can be not justified for using violence for a good cause. 

I don't think the shitty state of the country changes the definitions of violent and peaceful. And labelling their efforts as violent doesn't mean I don't think that they are justified. ",-1,t1_e3nn1wa,6,-1,2018-08-05 18:05:04

">	In 1075 the Venetian doge married a byzantine princess named Theodora who travelled to Venice with a large dowry containing, among other things, golden forks. The Catholic church when they saw this “horrible” tool forbade its use as it was an affront to God. God had given us fingers to eat, not using them was considered a sin. “God in his wisdom has provided man with natural forks—his fingers. Therefore it is an insult to him to substitute artificial metal forks for them when eating”. As a consequence, forks were not be seen again for another 300 years in Europe but by the 1400s they start to appear again in Italian households.

"Our population growth rate is 1.9. Our Birth rate is already lower than that of the US.

Don’t talk about things you have absolutely no knowledge of. 

Our high population is due to 2 things:

1. Largest Delta in the world

2. Rice

Places where rice is the staple food always have huge populations because rice is easy to cultivate, lasts a long while, takes little to be full. Couple that with us being the langest delta thus being the most cultivatable place on earth. You get the point.

Holland is the largest delta in Europe, guess which is the most densely populated country in Europe? 'nuff said.

This is the reason our population was so high even a thousand years ago. In the middle ages Gauda was the 3rd most populous city in the world and one of the most prosperous. We experienced a huge birth rate post ww2 - but so did most countries, it was due to the innovation of modern medicine, we already had a sizable population so it’s obvious that ours was so exponential. 

Throughout history this region was always prosperous, we had 12% world GDP in the 18th century. That changed after the brits came of course.

Its not a crime to not know about stuff, but it is a crime when you try to peddle your racist agenda even when not knowing.

">racist agenda

Ahhh yes, it's always racism.

The fact is that you are a very young nation (average age 27 years). Your growth rate is 1% and of the USA is 0.13%. You have 2 million more births over deaths. In the USA the live birth is almost equal to the death rate. LOL you compare yourself to America - a country literally 60x the size.

Also, you as a nation now live longer and longer (which is a great thing), but this also means that you'll reach 200 million in just 30 years. Good luck living in rather a small country with the population of 2.5 Germanys. And it has nothing to do with your race. I would never live in the Netherlands or any similar country. But even the Netherlands seems like a paradise compared to you.",1,t1_j1986im,8,-1,2022-12-22 19:04:40
">Ahhh yes, it's always racism.

What else honestly? I honestly don't understand what other reasoning would you have to come to another country's subreddit and peddle how shit they are. If it's to make fun of our football culture, so be it. Our football culture was huge in the 90's and 80's but due to lack of infrastructure and extreme corruption our local league is shit. People just *casually* follow countries similar to how many people follow club teams.

Nice strawman, I compared ourselves to US with only *one* sector and because of the fact I have stated above. Also population growth rate is not an issue anymore for us. The current TFR of Bangladesh is 1.9, which is already at replacement level, and the growth rate is decreasing year by year. If you really want to poke your nose into population issues, do that with Pakistan, who have a TFR of 3.17 or Nigeria, with 5.

Also we have enough land to fit over 200 Million people if the day comes, but the fact of the matter is population would be decline after that anyway going by the current trajectory.

In 1971 our country was called a ""Basket Case"" by Henry K*ssinger, with no natural resources, high population density - it seemed that way. But we have defied all odds, and have progressed astronomically in the last 30 years alone. We have arrived at an era where we are better in all aspects than the country we got independence from. We have also been named among the ""Next 11"" by numerous organizations.

">U don't believe in our freedom struggle

I didn't say I don't believe in the struggles of our people. I just said that Mujib may not be the person we were taught him to be. Our country always whitewashes radical peoples in history. Makes them sound like they were really nice people who never did a single wrong in their entire life. Also just because some Pakistani cunts from 50 years ago commited mass genocide on innocent people doesn't mean we should hate the current generation of Pakistani's. 



>u don’t believe in the idea of our country

What I dea? That everyone is free? Free my ass. We don't even have freedom of speech. Anyone who talks against the govt. Gets killed. Votes are rigged so that no one can challenge their place. Is this the Idea of our country eh boy?

>have no right to insult our freedom struggle.bastard

Again I didn't insult our struggle in the war. I just said events in history may not have happened in the same way that we're taught it did. There's always truths hidden.

>u are a disgrace, leave this space and leave this country

Yes i am a disgrace. I know it and I completely own it.
I don't brush it off as nothing. And yes I will be leaving this god forsaken country which would just a miracle to recover when I'm old enough to travel to another country.

Remember ignoring your country's problems and thinking they're the greatest in the world doesn't make you a patriot. It just makes you an idiot whos ignorant to a bliss.

"You were quick to judge! I was not talking about mobile games either, in fact I wasn't even thinking about mobile games. I strictly game on PC. Anyway, my point was, Bangladesh has not done anything remarkable to get an acknowledgement. So I am not surprised people still doesn't know about us, especially if they are Europeans.

I have been living in Germany for the past 2.5 years. People usually recognizes us with something associated with either Cricket or India or with something bad that we have done (which I am not proud of, I stopped telling people that I am from Bangladesh unless it's necessary, they now assume I am Indian or something). And pretty much 30% - 40% of my teammates never even heard the name when I que matches from here, just like you never heard of that random african country. I wouldn't label it as ignorance to be honest.",1,t1_h4k1djz,4,-1,2021-07-09 04:23:45

I would place the tag on EU countries, some South American countries, the Asian tigers and of course Uncle Sam. There are a lot more countries that people with basic geography knowledge do not know the existence of, I would say the same for Bangladesh maybe 10 years back but I feel like we have been doing good as a country to get recognition overall.

I suggest:  

Title of thread:  How You Can Help (Please Read)   

Then something like:  

We will use this thread to list ways people around the world can help the students and people in Bangladesh.  

That is enough to start with.   

Also, you can also add these two urgent needs we have right now (maybe format it better):  

- getting this thread upvoted and seen:

>https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/94qb7m/bangladesh_government_is_at_war_with_its_children/  

And contacting Facebook, which is posted on the live thread (asking them to remove the listing of people's contact info and addresses.   Scroll down in the live thread, and info is there.   

You can just say ""We urgently need people to contact Facebook. See the live thread for details"".

"It’s really funny, that our Bangladesh government is taking credit for her hard work, her news and achievement are in all the channels in Bangladesh right now.  Shame on the government, not only they don’t do anything help normal people to develop their skills, don’t create any platform free from corruption.  But they will take any credit a single individual has earned by his or her own personal effort, which includes going through the corruption hardship the Govt has set at every stage. Not only this chef, but they repeatedly does it with anyone iconic. Seen too many times in the recent past.  

And lot of people in this page r questioning her nationality.  Why care whats her true nationality? As long as she identifies herself as a Bangladeshi, and cooking Bangladeshi food at such an important cooking show, she has done more for Bangladesh’s image then millions of us can ever do.  So let’s give her the credit and appreciation that she is so clearly deserves !!! She is a patriot",28,t3_oj1tes,0,1,2021-07-13 08:00:50
"Can't believe people are after Bangladeshis supporting her. Who cares about her nationality? I would've been supporting her if she was some white Aussie too. She has appreciation for my heritage, and makes beautiful foods with my country's cuisine, so of course I'm going to be happy about it! Her identifying strongly with her Bengali heritage is another plus point and people being salty about us praising her really need to get a life. Being born in a Western country doesn't mean you have to discard your parent's culture and heritage",31,t3_oj1tes,0,-1,2021-07-13 04:42:45

"That is the boldest move anyone could pull. 💯 this is gonna cost her the title, but she is going down as a legend in history for this move! 

In the final no one cares about heritage and looks that much but the taste have to be at peak. And even though this food have thousand of year tradition, it  will not be tasty enough to make it through the finals. You can enhance the flavor for a certain dish only to a certain point.

"I work in the fish farming industry.  At the most remote village areas of Bangladesh.  We get no help from the government as farmers , even after all the help Government announced in the media we r gonna get, specially during the covid time. 

Now I don’t mind that.  But anytime  a farmer makes a profit , the media comes and tells how the farmer became so successful due to government’s help. When we know they didn’t do shit.  

Now I know at this event the government didn’t take any direct credit, but we all know they control the media.   Yes, on one hand her success should be celebrated , but on the other hand , the way the government is showing it , it’ send a wrong message to others including international media , that all Bangladeshi’s are like her, when we are not.  That’s how I see government taking credit.

"I guess you are right. But to be honest with you, it goes just as a far as the food and the fun. People from other nationalities

The reason I don't think this young lady should be THIS celerated in BD because for one:

1. She is Australian, not Bangladeshi. Yes she might be ethnically, but I can promise you she won't bring about any usefulness to the country
2. It gives the government a scapegoat to not better their own country. As in, by holding to the very thin thread that is her ethnicity, they try to sort of implying that her achievements are shared by them. It allows them to ignore the many geniuses, chefs, scientists, and literary masters in BD currently. If I can give an example, a girl here, London, has invented a disinfectant liquid that once sprayed on any hard surface it will make the surface covid proof for 14 days. Ain't that amazing? Well, she was all over the news in BD. When she was interviewed later by a Bangladeshi host in BD, he asked her ""You are Bangladeshi, when are you sending this stuff to us?"". She replied with ""I will focus on getting my country back in shape frist"", then he said ""your country?"". Then she said, ""Yeah, I'm British, I will get my country well before anything else."" He acted so shocked and she was very confused. This girl is 4th gen, British, the hell did he expect? The UK gov gave her a HUGE endowment and salary to produce her product, why should she not be thankful? Why would she supply her product for free to a country that didn't know she existed a week ago?

When we celebrated her achievements it was because it would benefit US. When we celebrated the achievements of the 17 year old chemist who found a way to mold copper and crystal, it was again because it would benefit us. We are ethically Bangladeshi, but I say this out of love, focus on your country. We aren't gonna help. I know it is a hard pill to swallow, but it's reality.

We don't identify with people in Bangladeshi so rightfully, you shouldn't do the same. 

I know this comment is silly given this is a cooking show, but it becomes more serious when it comes to medical discoveries.

I know how to cook Bengali meals, and I LOVE IT. But I'm not gonna fight for Bangladesh.

"Well I’m not a Bangladeshi citizen and I think your opinion is rather generalised. Kishwar has been very open about her Bangladeshi-Australian identity. Her parents literally created a community Center to keep the heritage alive. And this is common in other countries too. 

Kishwar is a particular individual who has time after time unapologetically shown off her Bengali heritage. Food aside, she wore a Selwar Kameez to almost all if not every single day in the Masterchef kitchen and if you follow her on social media you’d be aware that she has been very much appreciative of the immense support she has received from the Bangladeshi community. 

You may not strongly identify with the Bangladeshi identity but it is evident Kishwar does, like me and many other Bengalis who don’t have a Bangladeshi passport, and if she didn’t no one would really support her

And your analogical comparison is rather silly but I’ll leave you with your opinion. But you don’t have to speak for others, because like Kishwar and me, we do strongly identify with Bangladeshi people",0,t1_h51rgv5,3,-1,2021-07-14 16:19:49

"I don't know about pepper spray so can not say but tear gas is an aerosol, ie solid molecules suspended within a harmless gas. The solid molecules react with moisture such as sweat or the moisture in your eyes to produce the painful gas which actually hurts you, which is why a water soaked rag round your mouth is helpful, as the molecules react to the moisture on the rag rather than being drawn in to the body and reacting to the moisture in your mouth and lungs.

If it's tear gas you're facing then there is no way a dry cloth is going to clear all of those solid molecules that were suspended in the gas, they will be clinging to your eyelashes, hiding in wrinkles of skin, etc.

A technique for clearing tear gas which I have used before goes like this:

* 1 - Get the patient to hold their breath then quick wash over the face, particularly hair such as eyebrows or beard. This first all over wash is to bring the molecules stuck to the patient's face in to contact with liquid, forcing them to expend their gas. 
* 2 - Get the patient to kneel in front of you with eyes tightly closed and saturate their eyes with water. The aim is to ensure the eyelashes and wrinkles in the skin around the eyes are cleansed as this is where the aerosol molecules will be hiding.
* 3 - With the area around the eye clean you can now start irrigating the eye itself. Tears will naturally flow from the inside of the eye to the outside so follow the same path. With eyes open use a bottle of water, pour it from the nose out towards the side of the face so the water is following the path of their tears.
* Note - Even for an experienced medic it is often best to get the patient to perform step 3 themselves. Eyes are delicate and the patient will know better than you how much water they need to clear their eye.

Best of luck and may the situation be resolved to help all. There is the heart of a Scottish wildcat with you even if I lack the means to join you in body.",4,t1_e3nqygn,1,-1,2018-08-06 03:30:38

"A lot of misunderstanding with this tweet. 

The author isn't mocking Bangladesh. He is using Bangladesh as an example of a non-East Asian country adopting some of the development patterns of East Asian economies in the past, by focusing on manufacturing. A lot of people implicitly imply that the east-Asian development model cannot be successfully applied to non east Asian states, especially South Asia and Africa, due to cultural reasons. They may be partially right. But Bangladesh at least followed some (if not all) of the development traits of East Asian countries. The biggest difference being the lack of solid human capital investments, particularly in education. Just compare the education level of Vietnam with BD. Vietnam scores are higher than many developed countries in international mathematics and science rankings. Bangladeshi pupils can just about read and write, and that's it. Not really comparable 

If you read his op-ed, he shows how Bangladesh's development curve has been almost perfectly smooth, whereas for her neighbors, it was (still is) much more turbulent. In other words, Bangladesh is the cumulative result of decades of sustained growth, at least from the 1990s. And the manufacturing sector had a role in that. 

It's worth noting that South Korea was once known as a T-shirt making country, with labour costs even lower than Pakistan/India in the 1960s! The East Asian economic model is nothing radical, it's quite simple in principle. You start off from basic, build competency, open up your markets to the rest of the world, accumulate wealth, and go up the value chain. Easy in principle, but difficult in execution though. You need a strong, preferably technocratic government, functional institutions, and the rule of law to make it work fully. Which Bangladesh does not have. 

Bangladesh is moving up the value chain fast, but it's early days. We never had the capital or the infrastructure (especially our previously anemic energy grid) to upscale and grow factories and production. But now, things are changing. The RMG industry isn't even close to its full potential. Expect it to grow further, but also expect other industries to grow in parallel. 

For obvious reasons, India will always have a far larger industrial firepower than us, given their size. It's like comparing Russia with say, Poland or Estonia. The latter two can never compete with Russian when it comes to heavy industries like automotive, aerospace, space, infrastructure, even bio-tech. But Poland, and Estonia in particular, found their own niche which they were really good at. As a result, Estonia is far more prosperous than Russia these days. Though sanctions/oil prices had something to do with Russia's stagnation, I hope the point stands regardless. India had TATA steel as far back as the British Raj. Bangladesh was pretty much all an agricultural land that saw very little development under the Brits and Pakistan. Non-the-less, Bangladesh is industrializing big time now. We won't be able to match India in quantity/diversity even, but we can sure give them a run for their money in quality, on the few things we produced. Garments were one area, but now we're focusing on electronics, shipbuilding, steel processing. 

On the other hand, India is becoming much more closed off. It relies on heavy protectionism because her industries, as big, mighty, and diverse as they are, aren't generally competitive enough in the global market. They rely primarily on domestic consumption. Modi can have a go at that, let's see where it gets him. When all the successful economies that had emerged from the developing world, got thereby making things people around the world want to buy. 

Basically, India is not a good development model for us to follow. Yet many of us have this obsession with our dysfunctional neighbors when we can learn much more from others.",4,t3_o7r5jz,0,-1,2021-06-28 14:02:44

West Bengal had a massive headstart compared to everyone. They had the highest per capita income in India in the 1960s.It went all downhill after that.Today it's [23rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_and_union_territories_by_GDP_per_capita) and getting even further left behind  (much lower growth than Indian average during the 2010s).Nothing wrong with left wing but communist idiots went full blown anti business ,anti property and even anti common sense once they took power.Communists banned [English](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/05/world/west-bengal-halting-teaching-of-english-for-primary-students.html) for example in government primary schools.They called it a imperialist language.They also opposed computers and banned them for a long time.Businessmen were openly beaten up.

&#x200B;

>They didn't have to deal with a brutal independence war and one military dictatorship after another like Bangladesh did.

This is why a lot of Indians admire and compliment Bangladesh for its growth.Not  because we compare it to India (which is too diverse) but west bengal. Bangladesh had no choice other than develop. Most people couldn't just leave for foreign countries unless illegally. In west bengal,those who could,simply left the state for more prosperous states. Kolkata was the only metro city in India in the 2000s that saw its [population decline](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/kolkata-s-population-drop-leaves-experts-puzzled-111051600003_1.html). That's insane especially in a country where the population is still increasing.

&#x200B;

>Bangladesh and West Bengal more or less have the same living standards, as far as I know.

Certainly not true. Perhaps the middle class but the poor are probably much better in Bangladesh. Important to know that middle class in west bengal is  smaller and mostly employed in government sector. They actually benefit from the status quo because Kolkata is pretty cheap to live in and govt salaries are pretty good.There are barely any large private industries there.Most young Indian Bengalis you encounter on social media actually live outside bengal or plan to leave because they see no future.",3,t1_h338j03,4,0,2021-06-26 14:47:22
"It's a big complex question facing every Indian, each state  - I can give you a geoeconomic, socio-political and policy based answer. Reality is probably a mix of all. For e.g. Urbanization sets of virtuous cycles that erode things like caste consciousness.

That said, Delhi/NCR is quite rich with a PPP per capita \~ 20,000 and 25 million people so clearly it can be done.

First the big obvious issues, then more speculative ones -

**1) Geography** 

Ports. Landlocked regions suck for export oriented manufacturing. Automobile manufacturing came up in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat much later than Delhi (Maruti Suzuki) - but because they were easier to export from they grew much larger faster than the industries in the landlocked state which only have competitive advantage when building for the local market.

North India used to use the Ganga as a ""port"" or a sea substitute of sorts, but (a) it's not well developed as a shipping route, and (b) the population now is too large to rely on a river for large scale industrial trade.

The only real port in the North - Calcutta, dropped the ball badly by electing communists and Mumbai, Chennai, Kozhikode etc did not.

**2) Economic Policy**

So we have established reasons north has advantages as an effective industrial center for its substantial domestic market, it has a lot of mineral resources, but disadvantages when it comes to export oriented manufacturing. The government came up with a classic genius Indian govt policy called **freight equalization** \- which basically said that you would pay a constant subsidized price for transporting raw material like coal, steel, etc anywhere in the country, (but this did not apply to finished goods). As as result of this policy, most of the landlocked states saw deindustrialization as local industries stopped doing value addition - e.g. instead of doing vertical integration of iron ore -> steel -> machinery leveraging proximity to mine and market, the local economies focused on resource extraction and agriculture to maximize subsidy utilization, while assembly and manufacturing came up near the port cities mainly in the south.

Old industrial centers like Kanpur died out during this time. So north had disadvantages in manufacturing - this policy exacerbated the difference and deindustrialized the north and made it a farming/resource extraction hub, while giving fat subsidies to port exporters. It took ages for people to realize that this was a stupid move.

**3) Politics**

Calcutta was a big port in the north - and communist rule destroyed it. When the communists realized economics and decided to set up a tata nano manufacturing plant, TMC came and became more communist than the communists and rioted there, destroyed the plant and got elected. Now the TMC is realizing that economics works and making reform - I fully expect the people of West Bengal to self sabotage even further by electing someone else.

UP is our own Hindu Pakistan. Less said the better.

Bihar is highly agrarian and thus super casteist. It also had a lost decade+ of sorts under Lalu Yadav who basically 'empowered the lower castes' - i.e. told the police to look away as his caste went open season on the upper castes and the dalits. It was basically anarchy until the central government imposed presidents rule and a reformist PM

**4) History**

North India's traditional export routes go through Pakistan, which are now gone. South India has always had a tradition of sea based trade. The North is also more invested in the India-Pakistan drama, angry about perceived excesses under Muslim rule, and dealing with Pakistan turns you into a mean angry human on the best of days, which might play a role (this is just a theory).

e.g. sort of like how the people of don't care about themselves as long as they hurt India - UP, Bihar, MP etc sort of don't have strong sub-nationalism and identify as 'pan-Indian' and are happy as long as India as a whole is doing well (or at least better than Pakistan) instead of focusing inwards and fixing their own specific issues. This is conjecture - but basically since all of India's hostile borders are in the north - the north is more pre-occupied in this siege mindset of feeling responsible for preserving the territorial integrity of India, which can be exploited for hindu-muslim political bullshit.

**5) Language?**

This is an interesting thing that I've been thinking of lately. All of north India is not poor - Delhi is rich, Punjab, Haryana, Western UP (Noida), Uttarakhand and even J&K are quite reasonably well off. The main poverty hot spot is the overpopulated hub of Eastern UP/Bihar, which incidentally is where I trace my lineage from.

Now one thing about the Bihar region is that it's local languages are Bhojpuri, Maithili, Angika, etc - which shares a common linguistic ancestor with Bengali but are classified as dialects of Hindi rather than separate languages (although there's a ton of evidence that this is idiotic).

As an ethnic maithil/bhojpuri I have lost my mother tongue in that sense and only know Hindi, this is ok for Urban India where Hindi and English will get you through - but in rural Bihar/Bhojpur - the kids of this region have been taught for decades in Hindi, a language nobody at home speaks - which has led to the state having the worst literacy outcomes in the country.

As most B'deshis will probably understand the importance of having education in your mother tongue as a key ingredient for improving mass education - this ingredient was missing in the east UP/Bihar region.

The tribal regions of Jharkhand, Chattisgarh have similar issues because they speak austroasiatic languages - not even indo-aryan/dravidian - and it will be unlikely that they get educated in their native languages.",4,t1_h3454cx,4,0,2021-06-26 20:47:49

"Lol. Both Bihar and WB are growing GDP per capita faster than UP.

[https://statisticstimes.com/economy/india/indian-states-gdp-growth.php](https://statisticstimes.com/economy/india/indian-states-gdp-growth.php)

Last year before the pandemic nominal GSDP grew 15.36% in Bihar (2nd highest in the country) and 15.04% in WB (3rd highest). UP? 6.5% - the lowest of all states for which data is available - and that's despite UP getting free runoff growth from Delhi NCR in Noida (where for e.g. Samsung has built the world's largest smartphone factory) for which the state honestly deserves zero credit. 

Please check your information sources, you might be stuck in a certain political party's disinformation narrative.

Bihar's been growing rapidly ever since Lalu lost power, but 15 years of negative growth is no joke to recover from. TMC is more middle-class and growth oriented today than the days when it carried out the Singur violence.

That wasn't exclusive to Bengal. The decline started long before. There was never any shortage of Bengali talent. They just got jobs outside Bengal.  There were multiple reasons for Bengal decline - with commies getting control the biggest. Industrial decline started as soon as commies gained control for the first time. Bengal also couldn't get IT in time because of commie opposition to computers. in the 1970s and 80s. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was the only visionary commie leader and he tried his best to get Bengal back into track. Most of the big IT names in Kolkata came during time.

"I am blaming the state of UP right now, i.e. the current GDP growth rate, on BJP. Last year before the pandemic it had the lowest GDP growth of all major states.

That said no party in UP has a good track record - SP, BSP, Congress and now BJP all have played communal and caste politics to win, and delivered little to no growth. Maybe the relationship is inverted - that they are forced to play identity politics to win because nobody has figured out how to make UP grow.

Many people supported BJP when they won in UP even if not elsewhere in India, the propaganda in the educated BJP supporter circles was that Manoj Sinha (current LG of Kashmir, who is an IIT grad) would be the technocratic chief minister who would develop UP and Yogi Adityanath was portrayed as a 'fringe' figure after sharing the dais with a man who wanted for Hindus to dig out the corpses of muslim women and rape them.

Fast forward a few years, people have forgotten all of this. Manoj Sinha is in an unenviable position of being responsible for solving extremism in Kashmir. Adityanath was mainstreamed and made CM, is being whitewashed as some great administrator despite delivering no GDP growth, and is now the most popular CM in India for whatever reason that you probably will know better than me given your obvious  leanings.",1,t1_h3ab35t,6,-1,2021-06-28 10:34:19

Same issue with my best friend, he has God given talent in drawing & creativity till the time we were kids, nobody taught him anything, but he never practices diligently and tries to improve. If I was him I would have bet everything on my talent and would have become world class Artist. It just pains me to see his talent not being utilized.

I would suggest your cousin to accept that he has the talent in himself and look inside him seriously to  decide if he wants to improve further. Cause he still has much to improve and even talented people needs hard work to truly reach their potential.",8,t3_qlyme3,0,1,2021-11-04 02:47:39

After confronting some of them as to why they are constantly self ridiculing they have admitted that sometimes it's not a  serious thing. It may be a tactic to gain attention. Having self doubt and low self esteem can be worked on but if you give suggestions and the person constantly puts them down giving you one sob story after another you know what to do.,1,t3_qlyme3,0,0,2021-11-03 22:49:57

"I grew up in the U.S, my family came here in the 90’s. There weren’t a lot of Bangladeshis here in NYC while I was growing up and honestly I felt like it was alot better then.

My family was somewhat religious, we got along with our non Muslim-non Bangladeshi neighbors. Most of the Bangladeshis came though visa program. That program ended in the mid 2000’s and then more Bangladeshis came through chain migrations. A LOT more religious and conservative Bangladeshis who hate the culture here, and I felt life in general hasn’t been the same. More conservative religious values became common. Facebook just made it worse. I have family back in bangladesh who celebrated when the taliban taking over and complain all day about the U.S but will be coming here soon. I’m not looking forward to it. I wouldn’t want ANY Bangladeshi of that mentality to come here. 

I’m fully open to open minded more liberal folks coming here, but the conservative ones are making the community here even worse and are creating problems within families as most of the American born Bengalis hate those conservative ideologies. I personally am planning on leaving NYC to another state soon for those very reason and I know many younger, well educated Bengalis who feel the same way.",4,t3_u6z66k,0,0,2022-04-19 23:09:49

"Why are liberals so dumb... This meme wants to highlight how some people hates western values but still wants to move there. Which is understandable. But that does not mean adopting the western value but talking smack about it simultaneously is hypocritical . Westerners just have better education and jobs, not moral compass. So if a person does move to one only for those specific reasons but does not adopt their values is not a hypocrite. But a person who does js

Again people wants to move to western society to get better jobs and education. Not support the LGBTQ, and maybe settle there but what's wrong with that? People live in Bangladesh but complain about the law and so does the immigrant Bangladeshis in those societies(To themselves) . Atleast most of them...
 
 And also why do people in this sub reddit hate on Muslims and sharia law so much? Oh the islamists? Wow, they certainly are following the teachings and definitely aren't wrong. Man you guys are so baseless. Do some research smh

I'm not making fun of this meme or undermining it or anything, but the liberals crying about islamists. Which arguably both are assertive. But I say that Bangladeshi liberals are ruining what this country stands for, seriously they do. Bangladesh is supposed to see each other as brother and sister no matter what religion. Not attack each other for what they do and don't believe and force a certain agenda. So islamists and liberals are the same, except the islamists are more assertive as one may say. 

Also, the west are way more brutal than any Islamists ever, just look at israel and Palestine. Not to mention the west themselves ignoring their own teachings..(Israel) 

We love democracy? And protesting is OK? Nope kill Iraqis in fallujah for peacefully protesting and basically don't allow them to choose what they want to do but do it yourselves. 

Don't force anyone anything because that's anti-democratic? Cancel anyone not supporting the LGBTQ

Ummm.... Yes we would. If they didn't somebody else would have. That's how science works.What profound inventions have 'Muslim' scientists given the world in the last 800-900 years? What has been the contribution of 'Muslim' scientists in the ""Age of Science""?

"Their advancement in science and technology is based on their “morals, ethics and values”. Shall we go over how they have come to such technological advancements? Let’s take recent examples in medicine: the Henrietta Lacks fiasco, embryological gene manipulation, human experiments performed by Klingman, Zimbardo, Milgram, Sherif and many more. All these unethical practices have led to scientific breakthroughs that has helped humanity in some way or other. They have come at the cost of people in the west, people you look down on. So, in that regard, the science is not separate from western morals and you picking and choosing what is palatable for you within the confines of Islam is purely for your own benefit. It allows you to navigate a complex world without having to dissect reality and acknowledge the sacrifices of the western world. You don’t respect what these people have gone through and categorize them under a blanket term of “unethical, immoral beings”. So far, you have only considered what you gain from them, but not what they have given up for you to have that advantage.

I am sure your views on “immorality” are based on how they treat LGBTQ people. While the western world’s history of morality has not been perfect, they acknowledge most of their mistakes and take steps to remedy the issues that have risen from faulty actions. We, on the other hand, still argue about child marriage and taking right away from people who have done nothing to harm others. It is hypocritical of you to think that eastern or Islamic values are somehow superior to western ones.

In comparison, family-based immigration to the US takes over a decade due to huge visa backlogs + the established Bengali diaspora there is smaller relatively, so most people that do ""make it"" in North America do so through education or employment, or they are only 2nd gen Bengali American/Canadians.

"I still don't understand how you are bringing moral values into science. Isn't science supposed to be free from all of that and be neutral ? And the progress in medicine you mentioned. Its not just that. Every single single human achievements and progress has dark past behind them.

And also why stop there ? Father of modern medicine is a Muslim guy. There are ethical , unethical, athiest, jews, christians, muslims, pagans etc. everyone's contribution to the knowledge and technology we have today and we all use daily. Scientific knowledge is not exclusively a result of western civilization or their own invention disconnected from everyone. Every single knowledge is based on the previous works of others from different parts of the world with different moral values. So its pretty childish to think that today's technological achievement is because of western values. 

Here is some interesting history to study for you. Learn how Muslims embraced philosophy-technology from the greeks, romans, persians and advanced human knowledge further that worked as the basis for the Renaissance later. 

And I think you also relating western quality of life with knowledge. Its the knowledge I am after which doesn't depend on their morality. Which is why thousands Muslims graduate from catholic schools and colleges in our country every year without converting to christianity. 

Lastly your comments on morality. Our morality is superior because it came directly from the creator. Not invented by any human. Its objective not subjective. I agree nuance is the key. Humans are terrible. But Islam's values and ethics are objective and eternal. Now existence of God and is Islam really God's rules are very different topics that requires lengthy discussions. Not gonna go there now. I just want to say your sense of morality is subjective. You subconsciously think that Islam's stance on many things are wrong and western stances are better. For example on LGBT. So why can't I think the same but in reverse that Islam's stance on it is right yours is wrong.

At no point did I say that today’s technology is solely attributed to western values, however, you have decided that it is superior so you must go to a place you view as inferior to acquire this knowledge. I do agree with morality being subjective. I didn’t say Islam is bad but what I did say is that it isn’t right to view one ideology as superior to another. In Islam, you are allowed to do things that would be morally objectional in the west and vice versa. Acknowledge the good and bad in all, nothing is perfect, because if it were then we wouldn’t be having these discussions. I respect your faith, but I would say open your heart to the stories and views of others to truly learn why they may be saying things you don’t agree with. You don’t have to change your views but be empathetic to the plight of others. Is it truly Islamic to view others as worse than you instead of treating them as equal?",4,t1_i5di74l,5,-1,2022-04-19 18:39:39
"> I was saying that back in the days they were muslims and scientists and their society was so ahead even western scientists used to arrive and live.

Agreed on the society part. Because the emperors back then were ardent followers of knowledge these guys could flourish which was lacking in the then christan dynasty. If you mean in a social structure that was predominantly ""muslim"" was key factor in them being the prominent faces back then, then I will have to give you this one. But them being scientists and them being individually muslim had no connection whatsoever.

"I see the underlying issue we have. You think I am targeting the actual people of west when I say Islam is superior. My hate and criticism is towards their morality and ethics not particularly the people. I am saying this like the third time now. I understand your point on science not being neutral in reality although it is in theory. But why is that relevant here. Let me give you an example. I love a writer called HP Lovecraft. His works are brilliant I love them. But Lovecraft was a racist in real life. So I hate his racism and him personally. But not his works. You see the point ? You mentioned the lives were affected to bring me those anti-biotics. Why does that matter. Isaac Newton was a christian. And I hate christianity. Does that mean I cant use his first law ? Or everytime I do I have to go on a guilt trip remembering this law was invented by a christian ? This was funny at first but its getting ridiculously absurd dude. 

 And as you said its not all black and white. The west is not a monolith. One of the strongest and vocal Muslim community today exist in the west. 

Also you assumed my heart is not open. I am constantly learning and discussiing about western philosophy, ideas, logic etc. My hatred is not based on blind prejudice. Its actual logical criticism.

Edit: My final point and summary. My sense of moral superiority has nothing to do with our shared humanity. I can think your way of life is dumb af and also in time of need  help you out of your misery at the same time.",-1,t1_i5dlclh,6,-1,2022-04-19 19:00:35
">them being scientists and them being individually muslim had no connection whatsoever

congrats for getting that after so long. my initial point was just that and I don't know how many times I have to say these, western countries nowadays are more advanced not because of them being less religious nor us being shit is because being religious like the OP wanted to say. And just to prove that I gave that historical example which totally goes against the original meme post.  


>Did you personally know them? Were they ardent followers of Islam? What part did them being a ""muslim"" play in their groundbreaking inventions?

sorry to say this but the more I read the more I feel like most of you so-called current-day progressive thinkers are ""Borolok baper arts pora chelemeye"" who think they know **Everything** after knowing **Something**. I mean I even told you to look for yourself. If you looked a bit you would have known. No, ""Science and Religion"" aren't connected, nor anyone's inventions but it was their identity that they were proud and somewhat vocal of it. I didn't personally know them but as someone who graduated from the same field as F.R.Khan who was known as the einstein of structural engineering, I have read about him. He performed Hajj and one of his last creations is the hajj terminal which he wanted to supervise personally cause he thought if any nonmuslim was in charge of the project they won't understand the islamic significance of it and it would be just a glass or concrete block in the desert. even somewhere he talked about the importance of knowledge/learning in islamic tradition (i don't remember the source).  
if you don't want to do some ""looking up"" just dont talk na. It would be much better. I myself am a pretty free thinker and not a hardcore religious but jesus it seems like you as well as some other people here can't register the simple thing that a person or a society can be religious and still be rich and scientifically knowledgable. Some of you get frustrated when someone even connects Islam and progress as a historical example like I did but I bet you nod along when some foreign media connects islam with terrorism. majority of the people in bd won't even do ""give me visa"" if the political situation was better and people's talents were actually appreciated here, no matter how much muslim rule there is.

You tried to make this point by mentioning how ""muslim"" scientists invented many of the most important inventions in the world? Do you really understand how silly this sounds? The person who brought religion and science together was you. We wouldn't be having this conversation if that wasn't said. So no your intial point definitely wasn't that. We all can read english here.



>who think they know Everything after knowing Something.

Sadly that seems to be you. You mentioned all these things about designing this and that, so if the same guy designed a Church would that mean christianity helped him in doing what he was doing? Understanding the concept of something you will design doesn't mean he did it from a sentimental point of view. And many muslim structures have been designed by non-muslims. This has literally nothing do with faith. You use your education and experience and mix it with the concept to design something. I am not a guy who flaunts my educational qualifications on social media. You are most welcome to assume whatever you like. But all you have said so far has been contradicting yourself. You say science and religion have no connection and then go ahead and try to relate them in the next paragraph.

>Some of you get frustrated when someone even connects Islam and progress as a historical example like I did but I bet you nod along when some foreign media connects islam with terrorism.

If there is a valid point I don't think anyone will get frustrated. If you forcefully try to connect two things that aren't remotely close people will always come back with questions.

This happened back in 2008.

A bunch of us were hanging out in a lemonade shop in puran dhaka, they had some speciality lemonade and we were there to check them out. A couple of these kind of old dirty lungi and fotua wearing uncles sat opposite us.One of our friend was from Bangshal,  she said in  a hushed whisper, don't underestimate these people, you'll never know how much dough one is carrying in this part of the town. 

Right after she finished saying this, our waiter delivered the lemonades to both parties. And one uncle get couple wads of cash out of his torn pocket, and gave the other guy. And he was so sorry, like bhai I only could arrange this 2 lac now, I'll give you the rest in the evening. 

And we were sitting here with eyes like saucers.

Because it is associated with people like this.

Who the hell sits with your bare feet on the chair in a place where people are there to eat food. We do not want to see your nasty feet. You think he is not aware of that?

But..... Few weeks ago i saw some students wearing Lungi at a food place. They were students of a friend of mine and he told me that, they hadn't actually wear them at home. So, they didn’t know what to wear and how to wear. Some of them wore their dad's Lungi, that looked awkward. And some of them wore ""মুসলমানির লুংগি"" which they grabbed from local market at a cheap price. But they looked ""Khet"" overall.

There is SUCH a power imbalance in this case- you’re talking about an alleged perpetrator who is one of the richest, most powerful, most well-connected people in Bangladesh. Getting justice is going to be extremely difficult without the public supporting her family and demanding transparency.

You're braindead If you think that the guy dating someone bellow 18 makes him a pedo.
Infact chances are, you're parents also had ballo bibaho,does that make your father a pedo? how many people in your family are pedos? Dont you fell ashamed to associate and mingle with them, with your strict moral code?
The europeans are much more enlightened In this regard, unlike the backwards mouth breathing americans.
First murderer,now pedo,lol, how much more bodnam are you gonna fabricate about an innocent man?
Do you really have to always resort to such lowly tactics when you see that you're losing an argument?

It seemed to me that most Bangladeshis are still stuck in the 1940s/1950s/1960s' mentality as  far as their outlook on employment is concerned.  Is it due to Bangladesh having been subjected to colonial rule for decades? Or is it simply snobbery? I saw many Bangladeshis saluting people however corrupt and bad they may be only because they are rich and powerful. Could such a society save itself from the brain drain d as its talented, smart, and industrious are fleeing the country in droves every year? Would such a society ever get rid of corruption?

Private vs Public University: I think both has it's own type of student body. I would not go and compare it as apple to apple. Personally I always felt since I did not get to go to Buet or some other good school I would not be as good. Then one day I started working in a job in a western company with another Buet graduate. That was enough for me to realize it did not matter at all.  


Brain Drain: Yes there will be brain drain and I hope BAL or any other BD government dose not make any stupid law to stop it. Only acceptable way to stop brain drain is change the corporate environment in BD and somehow create an environment where companies can flourish and innovate. Until that happens we need to accept that brain drain happens.

So everything I said in this thread should be taken with a grain of salt and I'd gladly appreciate it if someone stepped in to correct me in case I'm wrong.

Although the original point of my comment which is that studying in a private university doesn't automatically make you less talented (as a lot of Bangladeshis believe) still stands, I do agree that students from public universities tend to be a lot more talented than their private counterparts. But I think that's mostly because public universities (due to being cheaper and more prestigious) attract students from various different backgrounds who compete in fiercely competitive admission tests (So yes, I take back what I said about admission tests not mattering much, they do), where only a fraction of applicants succeed. Which means that getting admitted to a public university is a lot harder than getting admitted to a private university (where simply having parents with deep pockets is enough for the most part).",4,t1_h5ltcjs,2,0,2021-07-18 09:51:51

How does that differ from here? If he stayed he’d be a wage slave here, not some great innovator. At least in the US he can gain a large salary, larger than anything he could achieve in BD, along with various benefits and insurances, that will ensure that himself and his family are living comfortably.

*Indeed, those who disbelieve and commit wrong \[or injustice\] – never will Allah forgive them, nor will He guide them to a path. Except for the path of Hell; they will abide therein forever. And that, for Allah, is \[always\] easy. – (Surah Nisa, verse 168, 169)*

## But Who Will Enter The Hell First?

According to a hadith, the first three people whom Allah will call to send them to the hell will be a scholar, a martyr, and a wealthy man. The hadith is as follows,

## The Martyr:

 O*n the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) say:*

*The first of people against whom judgment will be pronounced on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who died a martyr. He will be brought and Allah will make known to him His favors and he will recognize them. \[ The Almighty\] will say: And what did you do about them? He will say: I fought for you until I died a martyr. He will say: You have lied – you did but fight that it might be said \[of you\]: He is courageous. And so it was said. Then he will be ordered to be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hell-fire.*

## The Scholar:

 \[Another\] will be a man who has studied \[religious\] knowledge and has taught it and who used to recite the Quran. He will be brought and Allah will make known to him His favors and he will recognize them. \[The Almighty\] will say: And what did you do about them? He will say: I studied \[religious\] knowledge and I taught it and I recited the Quran for Your sake. He will say: You have lied – you did but study \[religious\] knowledge that it might be said \[of you\]: He is learned. And you recited the Quran that it might be said \[of you\]: He is a reciter. And so it was said. Then he will be ordered to be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hell-fire. 

&#x200B;

## The Richman:

 *\[Another\] will be a man whom Allah had made rich and to whom He had given all kinds of wealth. He will be brought and Allah will make known to him His favors and he will recognize them. \[The Almighty\] will say: And what did you do about them? He will say: I left no path \[untrodden\] in which You like money to be spent without spending in it for Your sake. He will say: You have lied – you did but do so that it might be said \[of you\]: He is open-handed. And so it was said. Then he will be ordered to be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hell-fire.  –***(Sahih Muslim; Book #020, Hadith #4688)**

"The process of 'deciding what's the best course of action religiously' is not the same thing as critically analysis. You will have to remove the word religiously and replace that with some other words like critically, rationally etc in order for that process to be considered critical analysis. You can think of critical analysis as the study of Philosophy. Religion has its basis in belief. Philosophy , on the other hand, is a critic of belief and belief systems. Philosophy subjects what some would be satisfied in believing to severe examination. Philosophy looks for rational explications and justifications for beliefs. 

Philosophy is about thinking critically about religion in all of its aspects. Thinking critically about religious beliefs might indicate that they are flawed in a number of ways: inconsistent, contradictory, without evidence to support the basic claims. This is why questions of critical nature are not entertained in religions. It's a common practice to do critical analysis in science study.

Philosophy has come to reveal that religious beliefs are just that beliefs and not empirical claims. Religious language is not ordinary language and certainly not scientific language.

I think if these waaz programs can have their benefits and drawbacks as well. On one hand, I find it better people spend their time watching it rather than something like drama serials. On the other hand, the main intention should be for education rather than entertainment from the perspective of the viewers.

"Yes, what you say is true, it is based off of belief. But the meaning of the most religious action can change depending on the scholar. For example, it may include using reasoning and critical thinking in a situation, and observing the best route while still complying with explicit religious commands, or it could mean strictly applying the religious texts alone, without using any reasoning or assessment of the situation per say. So in that case, ""religiously"" has a multitude of meanings that are debated by the scholars. Without digressing further, critical analysis can be applied within the constrictions of explicit and well defined religious commands. Also, you might want to know that only scholars that have received ijazah, or permission, are allowed to make legal opinions, not a layman. Of course, following the explicit and well defined religious commands and boundaries is a matter of faith, howsoever one obtained it.",1,t1_gjvv3le,3,0,2021-01-20 08:19:08

I think they were envious that as a foreigner I could get close and ask such questions. 

After the Waaz I was invited on the mullah's table and ate with him. 

His English was better than my Bangla so we spoke in hybrid English/Sylheti.

Again I must reiterate the mullah was a very kind and understanding man. It was his entourage who were absolute cunts.

EDIT: Thinking about the encounter again, you are definitely right about how I phrased the questions.

Search godra kand wherein muslim burned hindu pilgrimage for being kaafirs.
Secondly our stance towards bengal has always been positive, in 2016 we solved our 50 yr old border issue.
Third we are not against bengali people instead we admire you for your growth ,we are even taught how Bangladesh is turning out into manufacturing giant in South Asia.
We are against illigal immigrants.

"Remittance is not stable, never has been. A majority of the remittances goes to family members, which means most of it is used for consumption and not production. Garment sector is actually quite stable, much more than FDI. FDI is very volatile but that doesn't mean it's bad, it actually promotes technological exchanges between countries. The reliance on any one sector is bad though, more so if the sector you're relying on is that volatile. Yes, we are relying on garments a lot as well, but policies to diversify our economy has been taken. That doesn't guarantee diversification, but it's still a step in the right direction. When it comes to economy all the government can do is enact smart policies that supports local businesses, the rest depends on the people. And about automation, they've been trying to automate garments industry for a long time, the nature of the work makes it very hard to automate, it's easier for robots to work with hard pieces of metals than it is to work with malleable cloths. And western companies never cared about slave labours, when people act up they launch a PR campaign and then keep doing what they were doing. Research a bit about the ""environment friendly"" fashion lines of these western companies, you will soon find out that all they do is make a pretty ad and then stick a  environment friendly label on them.",1,t1_guddmou,4,-1,2021-04-13 15:29:29

"> or on the page of a security company 

I'm inclined to give you credit for bringing this point in the context of the peacekeeping missions that are carried out (mind you, they are paid for it as contract work).

 It does come across as a poorly chosen slogan to recruit, but I do no disagree with the slogan itself. The pen and sword both are important tools (diplomacy and the threat of violence) to maintain one's sovereignty both as an individual and nation. 

 Having said that, we have a very uneasy relationship with violence (in our culture). The military machine ideally helps direct and develop this sense into a more organized manner (ideally) but unfortunately that becomes a 'hammer for every job' kind of situation. The best armies in the world use every tool at their disposal. 

A personal favorite quote from Jim Mattis can shed light: 
""Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everyone you meet.""

But he's also said this: 
“If you haven't read hundreds of books, you are functionally illiterate, and you will be incompetent, because your personal experiences alone aren't broad enough to sustain you.”

"I went to Mirzapur Cadet College in 2017, so things may have changed since then. I am not sure what you mean by ""clarify"" since there are dozens of things, but I will give you the philosophical issues with the army system.

The most predominant philosophy at Cadet was the idea that your group comes before yourself. So if you're doing drills in a group of 20, if ONE of you messes up, ALL 20 of you have to do the entire drill again. 

The 2nd thing is the completely bullshit rules just for ""discipline"". You are forced to shower in the morning in cold water even if you don't want to (btw there's no hot water even in the winter). You're also not allowed to do ANYTHING outside of the specific time slots allocated for said activities. So, if you have an exam coming up and you want to study instead of playing sports, you're not allowed to.

These are just some of them that are related to discipline. There's also a lot of bullying and ragging by the seniors, while the school authority does nothing about it.",5,t1_hbmry1w,3,0,2021-09-05 00:58:38

"Some other passages that stood out to me:

A Bengali student studying in Pakistan is criticized by a Punjabi for carrying a sitar...

*. . . I still remember one particular incident. When I was in Lahore, I used to take bus number 19 and go straight to Data Darbar to meet my ustad in the bazaar there. I remember it was a hot afternoon. It was around 2 p.m. when I jumped on the bus and went to the top floor . . . it was a doubledecker bus and there was only one other person sitting there. He looked at my sitar, which was wrapped in a cloth and asked what it was in Punjabi. I told him it was a baja (musical instrument) and he asked what I was doing with it. I said I was going to my ustad. He then wanted to know where I was from. By now I could sense that I was in trouble. When I told him I belonged to East Pakistan, he started saying “That’s why Bengalis are so bad. Instead of carrying a talwar, you have a baja in your hand.” I remember feeling ashamed and apologizing to him . . .*

A Pakistani business family in Bangladesh ignores the pleas of one family member to move back to Pakistan before the war starts. The family member was the only one who could speak Bengali and had Bengali friends giving him a clearer understanding of what was happening and was one of the few Pakistanis interviewed for the book that expressed strong sympathies for Bangladeshis.

*By that time I was done with my college, but my family was there. We had a large business there, so I had no reason to leave. But, yes, I could feel the pulse of the people and I would often tell my family to sell everything and move away. They would laugh at me. I remember my uncle saying, “If one fires a pistol here, you will not see a single Bengali from [Dhaka] to Chittagong. They will all run away. They are a cowardly nation.” They actually believed that. I would keep telling them to move to Lahore, to go back to West Pakistan, but they wouldn’t listen.’ Asif’s uncle’s confidence that the Bengalis would never be successful in forming an independent nation was matched by many of the people I had interviewed in Pakistan. They told me that they never imagined that Pakistan would lose the war, that there would ever be a chance of Bengalis having their way, creating their own country. In the popular imagination, they were seen as meek, powerless, lacking courage, as the ‘non-martial’ race. There was no reason to sell one’s business and leave because the Bengalis were no real threat in their eyes. [...] Later, when we lost everything—houses, property, cars, trucks, you name it—my uncles conceded that I had been right the whole time. They said, “Yaar, tu theek hi kehta tha [You were so right].” But they never listened to me then . . .*",65,t3_xt71ef,0,0,2022-10-01 21:50:18
