Don\'t forget Jamaat-e-islami a nefarious hardcore Islamic political party who does not believe in secularism. It\'s student wing is known for bomb attacks and machete killings. It has also committed war crimes during Bangladesh independence fight of 1971. It\'s leader once boasted of killing 1000 Biharis by himself in a single day. It\'s student wing Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir supports shariat and supports only madrassa education. In February 2014, US-based defense think tank IHS Jane\'s published a report titled ""IHS Jane\'s 2013 Global Terrorism & Insurgency Attack Index"", where Shibir(Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir) ranked third in a list of most active non-state armed groups in 2013.\n\nEvery minister has urged students to either go back to classes or be in home. Do accidents not happen in any other part of the world? Bangladesh has a good judicial system. Grievances could have been directed there. It\'s not like bangladesh is a rich country with surplus budget. \n\nThis agitation is nothing more than a ploy by opposition to sway the democratic election which are to be held later this year. It\'s politics on dead bodies(*Laash pe rajneeti karna*). The BNP and Jamaat both supported terrorist and militancy in India supporting the ULFA, NSCN (I-M), PLA and other Manipuri outfits found a safe haven in Bangladesh not only morally but financing and giving them living quarters after attack on India.\n\nAccording to the Saudi authorities, Khaleda Zia and her sons had an investment of around $12 billion in malls and other infrastructural projects in Saudi Arabia with the money amassed through bribery and extortion. As investigations are underway, more facts have surfaced about huge investments by the BNP chief\'s late son Arafat alias Koko, who died in January 2015. Koko allegedly made enormous investments in Saudi Arabia - all from ill-gotten wealth. He was also wanted in Bangladesh for multiple charges of corruption. Similarly, his brother Tareq Rahman, now in hiding in England, invested several millions of dollars in many foreign destinations with a large chunk of sum in Saudi Arabia and other West Asian countries. Earlier, there were allegations, many supported by evidence, that Tareq had nefarious dealings, including money-laundering and large investments, with the underworld dons, detrimental to Indian security interests.

Student Protests Links & Discussion Megathread,rambobilai,1065,389,"['BCL, BSL are taking away cameras from spectators and news reporters. can we get a drone camera there? in jigatola?', 'It looks like people are using their real names to upload photos, which is dangerous. There are a lot of other ways you can be identified, as well. Any device connecting to the internet has an ""IP address"" that websites can (and almost always) record, **and show your physical location**. (As specific as a ~~neighborhood~~ city block!) Further, your internet provider knows every website you use. Corrupt governments can and will find dissidents this way. Complete safety is impossible, but there are tools the minimize *some* risks. I don\'t know what kinds of devices people are using, but I\'ll try to cover the most common operating systems.\n\nMy **NON-EXPERT** advice:\n\nThe Tor browser is a great, free tool, for just this purpose. If you can\'t use Tor, there\'s the ProtonVPN program for Windows and MacOS, which you can use with any browser. It\'s a little harder to use on phones, because it doesn\'t have native apps yet, while Tor is available on Android ([Orbot plus Orfox](https://guardianproject.info/releases/)) but not iOS. ProtonVPN has a free tier, which is slow but secure - don\'t trust any VPN that has no paid tiers. Tor and VPNs encrypt information leaving your computer and pass it through one or more servers around the world, so that websites don\'t know what device you\'re browsing from, and the internet company doesn\'t know what website you\'re using. For the Tor Browser, use the ""[Bridges](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en)"" mode, so that you won\'t be identified as a TOR user. For VPNs, be sure to turn the ""start with [OS],"" ""auto connect,"" and ""kill switch"" options on, to minimize risk of accidentally exposing yourself.\n\nOne good things about the Tor Browser is that it can be run off of a flash drive, so you can use any computer. It\'s also standardized and has security settings defaulted so that it\'s more difficult to ""fingerprint."" If using a VPN, I recommend a new browser and settings/extensions shown [here](https://operational-security.com/3dsc-2-8-adjust-firefox-settings-security/) and [here](https://operational-security.com/firefox-security-privacy-add-ons/), to limit history/cookie collection, in case your computer is taken by police.\n\nOnly log into one service at a time, so that you can\'t be identified by cookies or cross-referencing accounts accessed. If using a VPN and a browser with container tabs, use container tabs if you need to log into multiple services simultaneously. Use a different username (unrelated to your identity/interests/biography - it can even be random, like mine) for each service (a password manager helps with this - keepass is free and there are versions for all operating systems), and don\'t give any real information when creating an account.\n\n[Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) is a privacy-respecting email service that you can sign up for with just a username and password, though you can\'t send or receive emails for 48 hours, if you trip their spam detection algorithm. [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) is a better email provider overall, but requires sms or email confirmation that you\'re a real person, which would be a problem if your text messages or emails are already being spied on and you can\'t create a Tutanota account or use an internet based phone number.\n\nMany news organizations use a tool called Secure Drop for uploading things. I don\'t know much about it, but by all means, use it - it\'s probably one of the best things you can do, **especially if you have photographs or videos that identify perpetrators of violence**. Thank you to the brave people who brought the protests to out attention, but please go to journalists first, not social media. Tell them everything you can in both English and Bengali - the basic information in English will let them work quickly and they\'ll find a translator to get the details from the Bengali. Links to news organization tips pages at the bottom - they all have instructions.\n\nFor communication within protest groups, ProtonMail is the best encrypted email and [Wire](https://wire.com/) is the best encrypted chat app. [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) uses phone numbers as usernames, which makes networking easier but may identify you. [Sudo](https://sudoapp.com/) (iOS only) gives you nine internet-based phone numbers and email addresses, which would be very difficult for the government to identify. Communication within the Sudo network is encrypted, but a few people downloading it and using the phone numbers and email addresses to create ProtonMail or Wire accounts for other protesters is perhaps a better use, since it\'s only for iOS. You can get three more identities per device with MySudo (the company is transitioning), but that app comes with very little call time.\n\nDo **NOT** use WhatsApp. Backups aren\'t encrypted and are on by default and it\'s owned by facebook, has poor account security and a history of cooperating with oppressive regimes. A lot of news organizations offer to communicate through WhatsApp, but I think that that\'s because it\'s popular, not because it\'s good.\n\nMetadata - sender/recipient and subject lines - isn\'t usually encrypted within apps, only the messages themselves, so a VPN is important. **Networks can be brought down by identifying who\'s messaging whom, even if the messages are unreadable**. This is usually done a more powerful government over a long period of time, but know that metadata is powerful - the US kills terrorists based on metadata. Journalists should be removing metadata (type of camera/phone, time, possibly location, etc.) from photos they use, but do it yourself before uploading them, anyway. You should be able to do so from your computer\'s file browser by right clicking properties>security or the equivalent.\n\nIf you need to secure photos/video to share with journalists later, email them to yourself rather than uploading them to social media. Even if they\'re not cooperating with the government, social media sites can and will delete violent content, just as a matter of policy. **Evidence of war crimes has been lost this way.** For larger files, sync.com is a cloud storage site with 5 gb free that is *probably* safe, but hasn\'t been audited for security like Tutanota, ProtonMail, Signal, and Wire and isn\'t old enough to have a track record. They don\'t ask for much information, and you should be connecting through Tor of a VPN, so there shouldn\'t be much that could go wrong with sync, anyway. You can use encrypted zip files both for an added layer of security and to reduce upload/download times, though you would need to either skip the encryption or communicate a password when sending the files, of course.\n\nI think all smartphones have full disc encryption as an option in the security settings. Use it, along with a [long passcode](https://operational-security.com/ios-full-disk-encryption/), if you have a smartphone. Disable location tracking and turn it off, whenever you don\'t need it on and are at a protest. If a police officer takes your phone while it\'s unlocked, they\'ll still get everything, but if you\'re arrested with it locked, it\'ll be potentially impossible for them to get inside, without you unlocking it. (That said, they could threaten/torture you; you may just be delaying the inevitable.) Computers can be more difficult. It would be easier to use Bleachbit or CCleaner to overwrite anything sensitive immediately after it\'s been uploaded to the cloud/journalists.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation has a [Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/) guide with more information. [Motherboard.Vice.com](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a37m4g/the-motherboard-guide-to-avoiding-state-surveillance-privacy-guide), as well. [The Paranoid\'s Bible](https://paranoidsbible.tumblr.com/post/160173700334/the-paranoids-bible-20) wasn\'t written with this in mind, but is also good.\n\nProtonMail uses the same PGP encryption that the EFF recommends, and, [as of last week](https://protonmail.com/blog/address-verification-pgp-support/), can work with out-of-network PGP tools. You also access it completely through an internet browser, so your emails are on a server in Switzerland, rather than your hard drive. Fewer potential points of failure, and you don\'t need to download anything to your computer for police to find. To send a PGP encrypted email from ProtonMail to a newspaper or journalist, add them to your contacts; [there will be an option to upload their public key](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/how-to-use-pgp/). With other PGP tools, you either need to install a browser extension and link it to your email account or download Thunderbird and link that, plus a plugin - I think this is a big improvement.\n\nGood luck, everyone!

This resulted in public outrage and protest that was greatly fueled by comments made by Shajahan Khan, President of the Road Transport Federation.

As of now, the government has made attempts to cut off mobile internet, stop news outlets from reporting on the incidents, and change the narrative so it would fall in their favor.', 'Link to article published by BBC talking about some of the protests, some quotes and other things. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-45074384 ', 'Attacks on students & protesters - \n\nhttps://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/dhaka/2018/08/02/chhatra-league-jubo-league-police-assault-and-chase-away-protesters-students-claim\n\nULAB students attacked after demonstration, allegedly by chatra league - https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/dhaka/2018/08/03/demonstrating-ulab-students-under-attack\n\n', 'A petition to the UN to enlist BCL, the student wing of the ruling Awami League party, as a terrorist organization is being circulated - https://www.change.org/p/united-nations-enlist-bangladesh-chhatra-league-bcl-as-a-terrorist-organization?signed=true', 'Photographer and social activist Shahidul Alam abducted from his home after giving an interview on Al Jazeera https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156648541748824&id=654418823', 'I keep seeing the odd post hit the front page then vanish.

I could\'ve been supporting the situation in the Middle East, or the crisis in Venezuela. But I\'m currently not. So why am I supporting this particular protest? Because of alot of reasons, most of which are the blatant violations of human rights (which is a huge point of the protest). But the main reason for me is censorship. And I HATE censorship. I hate being silenced and having my voice muted. Their government is taking down media and posts that were supposed to spread the untarnished truth of their grim situation. This makes it more important than ever to speak out. A government that causes problems and subsequently hides those problems, is an inhumane government. Some might argue that sharing on social media or signing some petition would just be ineffective slacktivism. But it\'s that attitude that suppresses the message from reaching the attention of both the masses and the international authority. We need two things from the world: their undivided attention, and their undying support. The second part should be easy as what is shown is obviously and undeniably wrong. But we haven\'t finished the first step yet. And hitting that share button or that ""sign this petition"" button might do just that, if enough people do it.\n\nI am making 2 points. That the government of Bangladesh is a horrible one. And that one should not think that they cannot do anything that makes a difference. Speak out.

Can anyone summarize or help me understand what is occurring in Bangladesh?,N/A,649,133,"['On the 29th of July, two bus drivers were racing to pick up passengers and killed two students who were waiting for a bus. Since then, high school and college students took to the streets and have been protesting peacefully against dangerous road conditions (i.e. no driving and traffic regulations and poor enforcement). They took it upon themselves to manage traffic (creating emergency lanes; arranging them according to vehicle size) and checking licenses of every passing vehicle (including police vehicles) on major roads. \n\nThere are several students now dead and missing; all they did was demand safer roads in a country where people die from road accidents every single day. They took to the streets and checked licenses, regulated traffic, exposed an incredible number of people including government and ministry workers for driving without valid licenses. They had been doing a better job than traffic regulation and law enforcement officers in the city, and all they wanted was an assurance of safety.\n\nThis protest was entirely peaceful, wholesome and supported by most citizens. The government’s reaction to this was to send out student political parties to also don school uniforms and partake in the demonstrations. These “students” infiltrated the protests and initiated violence both on the students and public property, followed by law enforcement doing the same: opening fire and using anti-riot equipment such as tear gas, aimed at protesters who were 13-20 years old.\n\nThis event has gained traction on international media recently, and has been covered by multiple media outlets such as the New York Times and BBC. However, they’ve stated multiple times that the government claims these were instigated by the opposing party, while other parties have been trying to twist the narrative to fit their own agendas. However, that is NOT true. These are young students protesting PEACEFULLY against law-breakers and unsafe roads, they have no political affiliations whatsoever.\n\nThe government has also shut down mobile data in the country and slowed down internet speeds. They have been arresting and detaining people for posting things online that implied dissent, and multiple journalists have been attacked, detained and had their recording equipment seized and destroyed. The media was made to withdraw many of their previous statements and say their sources were wrong, and some hospitals are being pressured into turning away students who were injured at the protests. \n\nToday, Bangladesh is a battleground. These ""student politicians"" have turned the streets into a hunting ground, chasing down these peaceful protesters and brutalizing them. They\'re literally hunting anyone that looks like a student and murdering and mauling in the most inhuman ways... And these monsters are supported by the government. Law enforcement and these thugs (who are all armed beyond their pay grade) have murdered multiple people already, committed other crimes like rape and also attacking those trying to help the children.\n\n', '[deleted]', 'Two students were run over by a Bus. They were found dead. This is not the first time this happened so the students and the people are outraged. They are protesting to make sure the minister of transportation resigns and that the corrupt police let drivers without license without any consequences. \n\n(Sorry if my English Is not perfect)', 'For people who wonder why Americans are so afraid of a tyrannical government, here is your sign.

', 'The same thing that had been happening for years all across the globe.\n\n1. General population (en masse, not a few individuals) stops recognizing government as the legitimate authority - in general, or on some specific matter.\n\n2. Status quo comes under threat. Examples need to be made.\n\n3. Right-wing ""militia"" (as a rule, gangsters of some kind - though, sometimes some or all *are* on government\'s payroll) gets mobilized and responds with deliberately public terror tactics: beatings, tortures, rapes, murders, etc.\n\n\tBasically, you lose any and all rights as a human if you challenge status quo (or, if you *look* like challenging it, since nobody actually checks - there is quite a lot of violence done for other reasons, but framed as political). As a rule, police/judiciary will not even pretend that they care, though they might attempt to arrest and persecute those who resist this open terrorism.\n\n\tAll of this is made painfully known to general population. All is presented as the new norm the society lives under.\n\n4. Response gets hijacked by politicians, who try to keep resistance within ""politically correct"" boundaries until it loses momentum and everything can go back as it was before (only with more crime, corruption, and violence).\n\n5. The rest of the world pretends that there was some kind of ""controversy"" and drowns out any discussions with meaningless jabber.', '[deleted]', 'I saw this trending sub Reddit and have no clue all of this was going on.

However, there's some fake images, videos and descriptions are being heavily circulated which might lessen the impact of the actual things that are happening, specially in the world media.\n\nOver the course of the last two days, the BCL members and other hired thugs attacked the student protesters and mercilessly beat them with steel rods, sticks and used machetes while the Dhaka Metropolitan Police either assisted them by hurling tear shells or stood around doing nothing. More than 150 students have been injured, some of them severely so, and most of them are getting treated in various hospitals. Again 20 to 25 journalists were   also brutally beat up by the same attackers. Students were also beaten up in the last few days. The editor(Who Is a woman) of a weekly magazine published by our nation's most widely circulated English Daily, The Daily Star, was beaten, dragged across the street and molested until she agreed to delete the footage featuring the BCL men committing atrocities. The condition here is truly horrible, but, a lot of people, specially on reddit are overstating various issues which might end up undermining the noble purpose and objective of the safe road protests.\n\nFor starters, while 3G and 4G internet services were shut down yesterday, they're back up now and most of the major and legit news outlets are reporting pretty much everything. And there's been no proof or validity of any of the rape and murder allegations that have surfaced so far. In fact, they've been disproved by trust-worthy news outlets such as The Daily Star and Dhaka Tribune. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not straight up saying they're untrue, and BCL members have been involved with many sexual assaults in the past, but none of the accounts in this case add up.A large number of female students are not missing and no dead bodies have been found on the spot where the clash occurred.\n\nI'm only sincerely asking you to fact-check everything you're sharing. Because there truly are government sanctioned attacks being launched by BCL, and in our current situation, we can't hold the PM accountable, and she's resorted to the tactic of dismissing everything as rumours. If fake news clouds the legitimate reports then I fear this rhetoric of the government might work. There's things happening that are truly terrible enough to grab the attention of the international media. For example, the police and BCL members are practically pouncing on the students of a University right now. That's why, once again, I implore you as a Bangladeshi to only share and circulate things that are definitely true."", 'Wow, thank you for the summary. Very informative.

I do not think our Journeys of June were for nothing, they\'re an event Brazilian millennials and post-millennials imprinted firmly in our history and that will remain forever, and those troubled times have changed the course of history for my country. We\'re still undergoing the subsequent crisis, but the hope has remained, and Brazilians have seen that we can and should stand up against the corrupt rulers, and we made them see that too. I hope with all my strength that the same can happen in Bangladesh, and that your people can rise beyond the turmoil and enact change.

But they will take any credit a single individual has earned by his or her own personal effort, which includes going through the corruption hardship the Govt has set at every stage. Not only this chef, but they repeatedly does it with anyone iconic. Seen too many times in the recent past.  \n\nAnd lot of people in this page r questioning her nationality.  Why care whats her true nationality? As long as she identifies herself as a Bangladeshi, and cooking Bangladeshi food at such an important cooking show, she has done more for Bangladesh’s image then millions of us can ever do.

But to be honest with you, it goes just as a far as the food and the fun.

Yes she might be ethnically, but I can promise you she won\'t bring about any usefulness to the country\n2. It gives the government a scapegoat to not better their own country. As in, by holding to the very thin thread that is her ethnicity, they try to sort of implying that her achievements are shared by them. It allows them to ignore the many geniuses, chefs, scientists, and literary masters in BD currently. If I can give an example, a girl here, London, has invented a disinfectant liquid that once sprayed on any hard surface it will make the surface covid proof for 14 days. Ain\'t that amazing? Well, she was all over the news in BD. When she was interviewed later by a Bangladeshi host in BD, he asked her ""You are Bangladeshi, when are you sending this stuff to us?"". She replied with ""I will focus on getting my country back in shape frist"", then he said ""your country?"". Then she said, ""Yeah, I\'m British, I will get my country well before anything else."" He acted so shocked and she was very confused. This girl is 4th gen, British, the hell did he expect? The UK gov gave her a HUGE endowment and salary to produce her product, why should she not be thankful? Why would she supply her product for free to a country that didn\'t know she existed a week ago?\n\nWhen we celebrated her achievements it was because it would benefit US. When we celebrated the achievements of the 17 year old chemist who found a way to mold copper and crystal, it was again because it would benefit us. We are ethically Bangladeshi, but I say this out of love, focus on your country. We aren\'t gonna help. I know it is a hard pill to swallow, but it\'s reality.\n\nWe don\'t identify with people in Bangladeshi so rightfully, you shouldn\'t do the same. \n\nI know this comment is silly given this is a cooking show, but it becomes more serious when it comes to medical discoveries.\n\nI know how to cook Bengali meals, and I LOVE IT. But I\'m not gonna fight for Bangladesh.\n\nJust felt like this needed to be said.', ""Doesnt make her Bangladeshi. She's Australian. This is why indians said she's indian."", 'lol ya...', ""Guess not. Doesn't change the fact that by nationality she is in Australia."", '[deleted]', 'sure', 'Well I’m not a Bangladeshi citizen and I think your opinion is rather generalised. Kishwar has been very open about her Bangladeshi-Australian identity. Her parents literally created a community Center to keep the heritage alive. And this is common in other countries too. \n\nKishwar is a particular individual who has time after time unapologetically shown off her Bengali heritage. Food aside, she wore a Selwar Kameez to almost all if not every single day in the Masterchef kitchen and if you follow her on social media you’d be aware that she has been very much appreciative of the immense support she has received from the Bangladeshi community. \n\nYou may not strongly identify with the Bangladeshi identity but it is evident Kishwar does, like me and many other Bengalis who don’t have a Bangladeshi passport, and if she didn’t no one would really support her\n\nAnd your analogical comparison is rather silly but I’ll leave you with your opinion. But you don’t have to speak for others, because like Kishwar and me, we do strongly identify with Bangladeshi people', ""She is just representing my country to an international level,cuz she got the chance to. It isn't some white people's legacy or so. I don't know if you are just jealous of her talents or have a disturbing mindset.🤷"", ""What's silly exactly?"", 'Additionally it’s not a hard pill to swallow that you don’t contribute to Bangladesh and have no intention of doing so. Bangladesh isn’t petty for ethnically Bengali foreigners trying to improve our image of a third world ‘poor’ country, BD has had a fair share of criticism from foreign nationals of Bangladeshi ethnicity, most of them don’t care though. \n\nBut again to each and their own.

The solid molecules react with moisture such as sweat or the moisture in your eyes to produce the painful gas which actually hurts you, which is why a water soaked rag round your mouth is helpful, as the molecules react to the moisture on the rag rather than being drawn in to the body and reacting to the moisture in your mouth and lungs.\n\nIf it's tear gas you're facing then there is no way a dry cloth is going to clear all of those solid molecules that were suspended in the gas, they will be clinging to your eyelashes, hiding in wrinkles of skin, etc.\n\nA technique for clearing tear gas which I have used before goes like this:\n\n* 1 - Get the patient to hold their breath then quick wash over the face, particularly hair such as eyebrows or beard. This first all over wash is to bring the molecules stuck to the patient's face in to contact with liquid, forcing them to expend their gas. \n* 2 - Get the patient to kneel in front of you with eyes tightly closed and saturate their eyes with water. The aim is to ensure the eyelashes and wrinkles in the skin around the eyes are cleansed as this is where the aerosol molecules will be hiding.\n* 3 - With the area around the eye clean you can now start irrigating the eye itself. Tears will naturally flow from the inside of the eye to the outside so follow the same path. With eyes open use a bottle of water, pour it from the nose out towards the side of the face so the water is following the path of their tears.\n* Note - Even for an experienced medic it is often best to get the patient to perform step 3 themselves. Eyes are delicate and the patient will know better than you how much water they need to clear their eye.\n\nBest of luck and may the situation be resolved to help all.

But BD messed up as well. All we have is garments export and labor export. We did not come out of it.', ""A lot of misunderstanding with this tweet. \n\nThe author isn't mocking Bangladesh. He is using Bangladesh as an example of a non-East Asian country adopting some of the development patterns of East Asian economies in the past, by focusing on manufacturing. A lot of people implicitly imply that the east-Asian development model cannot be successfully applied to non east Asian states, especially South Asia and Africa, due to cultural reasons. They may be partially right. But Bangladesh at least followed some (if not all) of the development traits of East Asian countries. The biggest difference being the lack of solid human capital investments, particularly in education. Just compare the education level of Vietnam with BD. Vietnam scores are higher than many developed countries in international mathematics and science rankings. Bangladeshi pupils can just about read and write, and that's it. Not really comparable \n\nIf you read his op-ed, he shows how Bangladesh's development curve has been almost perfectly smooth, whereas for her neighbors, it was (still is) much more turbulent. In other words, Bangladesh is the cumulative result of decades of sustained growth, at least from the 1990s. And the manufacturing sector had a role in that. \n\nIt's worth noting that South Korea was once known as a T-shirt making country, with labour costs even lower than Pakistan/India in the 1960s! The East Asian economic model is nothing radical, it's quite simple in principle. You start off from basic, build competency, open up your markets to the rest of the world, accumulate wealth, and go up the value chain. Easy in principle, but difficult in execution though. You need a strong, preferably technocratic government, functional institutions, and the rule of law to make it work fully. Which Bangladesh does not have. \n\nBangladesh is moving up the value chain fast, but it's early days. We never had the capital or the infrastructure (especially our previously anemic energy grid) to upscale and grow factories and production. But now, things are changing. The RMG industry isn't even close to its full potential. Expect it to grow further, but also expect other industries to grow in parallel. \n\nFor obvious reasons, India will always have a far larger industrial firepower than us, given their size. It's like comparing Russia with say, Poland or Estonia. The latter two can never compete with Russian when it comes to heavy industries like automotive, aerospace, space, infrastructure, even bio-tech. But Poland, and Estonia in particular, found their own niche which they were really good at. As a result, Estonia is far more prosperous than Russia these days. Though sanctions/oil prices had something to do with Russia's stagnation, I hope the point stands regardless. India had TATA steel as far back as the British Raj. Bangladesh was pretty much all an agricultural land that saw very little development under the Brits and Pakistan. Non-the-less, Bangladesh is industrializing big time now. We won't be able to match India in quantity/diversity even, but we can sure give them a run for their money in quality, on the few things we produced. Garments were one area, but now we're focusing on electronics, shipbuilding, steel processing. \n\nOn the other hand, India is becoming much more closed off. It relies on heavy protectionism because her industries, as big, mighty, and diverse as they are, aren't generally competitive enough in the global market. They rely primarily on domestic consumption. Modi can have a go at that, let's see where it gets him. When all the successful economies that had emerged from the developing world, got thereby making things people around the world want to buy. \n\nBasically, India is not a good development model for us to follow. Yet many of us have this obsession with our dysfunctional neighbors when we can learn much more from others."", 'Omg thia😂', 'True', 'Shirts', 'Your post is in the moderation queue awaiting approval.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Reality is probably a mix of all. For e.g. Urbanization sets of virtuous cycles that erode things like caste consciousness.\n\nThat said, Delhi/NCR is quite rich with a PPP per capita \\~ 20,000 and 25 million people so clearly it can be done.\n\nFirst the big obvious issues, then more speculative ones -\n\n**1) Geography** \n\nPorts. Landlocked regions suck for export oriented manufacturing. Automobile manufacturing came up in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat much later than Delhi (Maruti Suzuki) - but because they were easier to export from they grew much larger faster than the industries in the landlocked state which only have competitive advantage when building for the local market.\n\nNorth India used to use the Ganga as a ""port"" or a sea substitute of sorts, but (a) it\'s not well developed as a shipping route, and (b) the population now is too large to rely on a river for large scale industrial trade.\n\nThe only real port in the North - Calcutta, dropped the ball badly by electing communists and Mumbai, Chennai, Kozhikode etc did not.\n\n**2) Economic Policy**\n\nSo we have established reasons north has advantages as an effective industrial center for its substantial domestic market, it has a lot of mineral resources, but disadvantages when it comes to export oriented manufacturing. The government came up with a classic genius Indian govt policy called **freight equalization** \\- which basically said that you would pay a constant subsidized price for transporting raw material like coal, steel, etc anywhere in the country, (but this did not apply to finished goods). As as result of this policy, most of the landlocked states saw deindustrialization as local industries stopped doing value addition - e.g. instead of doing vertical integration of iron ore -> steel -> machinery leveraging proximity to mine and market, the local economies focused on resource extraction and agriculture to maximize subsidy utilization, while assembly and manufacturing came up near the port cities mainly in the south.\n\nOld industrial centers like Kanpur died out during this time. So north had disadvantages in manufacturing - this policy exacerbated the difference and deindustrialized the north and made it a farming/resource extraction hub, while giving fat subsidies to port exporters. It took ages for people to realize that this was a stupid move.\n\n**3) Politics**\n\nCalcutta was a big port in the north - and communist rule destroyed it. When the communists realized economics and decided to set up a tata nano manufacturing plant, TMC came and became more communist than the communists and rioted there, destroyed the plant and got elected. Now the TMC is realizing that economics works and making reform - I fully expect the people of West Bengal to self sabotage even further by electing someone else.\n\nUP is our own Hindu Pakistan. Less said the better.\n\nBihar is highly agrarian and thus super casteist. It also had a lost decade+ of sorts under Lalu Yadav who basically \'empowered the lower castes\' - i.e. told the police to look away as his caste went open season on the upper castes and the dalits. It was basically anarchy until the central government imposed presidents rule and a reformist PM\n\n**4) History**\n\nNorth India\'s traditional export routes go through Pakistan, which are now gone. South India has always had a tradition of sea based trade. The North is also more invested in the India-Pakistan drama, angry about perceived excesses under Muslim rule, and dealing with Pakistan turns you into a mean angry human on the best of days, which might play a role (this is just a theory).\n\ne.g. sort of like how the people of don\'t care about themselves as long as they hurt India - UP, Bihar, MP etc sort of don\'t have strong sub-nationalism and identify as \'pan-Indian\' and are happy as long as India as a whole is doing well (or at least better than Pakistan) instead of focusing inwards and fixing their own specific issues. This is conjecture - but basically since all of India\'s hostile borders are in the north - the north is more pre-occupied in this siege mindset of feeling responsible for preserving the territorial integrity of India, which can be exploited for hindu-muslim political bullshit.\n\n**5) Language?**\n\nThis is an interesting thing that I\'ve been thinking of lately. All of north India is not poor - Delhi is rich, Punjab, Haryana, Western UP (Noida), Uttarakhand and even J&K are quite reasonably well off. The main poverty hot spot is the overpopulated hub of Eastern UP/Bihar, which incidentally is where I trace my lineage from.\n\nNow one thing about the Bihar region is that it\'s local languages are Bhojpuri, Maithili, Angika, etc - which shares a common linguistic ancestor with Bengali but are classified as dialects of Hindi rather than separate languages (although there\'s a ton of evidence that this is idiotic).\n\nAs an ethnic maithil/bhojpuri I have lost my mother tongue in that sense and only know Hindi, this is ok for Urban India where Hindi and English will get you through - but in rural Bihar/Bhojpur - the kids of this region have been taught for decades in Hindi, a language nobody at home speaks - which has led to the state having the worst literacy outcomes in the country.\n\nAs most B\'deshis will probably understand the importance of having education in your mother tongue as a key ingredient for improving mass education - this ingredient was missing in the east UP/Bihar region.\n\nThe tribal regions of Jharkhand, Chattisgarh have similar issues because they speak austroasiatic languages - not even indo-aryan/dravidian - and it will be unlikely that they get educated in their native languages.', 'Yeah agree 100%.

I mean I even told you to look for yourself. If you looked a bit you would have known. No, ""Science and Religion"" aren\'t connected, nor anyone\'s inventions but it was their identity that they were proud and somewhat vocal of it. I didn\'t personally know them but as someone who graduated from the same field as F.R.Khan who was known as the einstein of structural engineering, I have read about him. He performed Hajj and one of his last creations is the hajj terminal which he wanted to supervise personally cause he thought if any nonmuslim was in charge of the project they won\'t understand the islamic significance of it and it would be just a glass or concrete block in the desert. even somewhere he talked about the importance of knowledge/learning in islamic tradition (i don\'t remember the source).  \nif you don\'t want to do some ""looking up"" just dont talk na. It would be much better. I myself am a pretty free thinker and not a hardcore religious but jesus it seems like you as well as some other people here can\'t register the simple thing that a person or a society can be religious and still be rich and scientifically knowledgable. Some of you get frustrated when someone even connects Islam and progress as a historical example like I did but I bet you nod along when some foreign media connects islam with terrorism. majority of the people in bd won\'t even do ""give me visa"" if the political situation was better and people\'s talents were actually appreciated here, no matter how much muslim rule there is.   \nlastly, if you want to rant further you can. but you won\'t be seeing any rants from me anymore. adios.', 'Ah yes, blame America for all your problems, while simultaneously wanting to live in America.

You mentioned all these things about designing this and that, so if the same guy designed a Church would that mean christianity helped him in doing what he was doing? Understanding the concept of something you will design doesn\'t mean he did it from a sentimental point of view. And many muslim structures have been designed by non-muslims. This has literally nothing do with faith. You use your education and experience and mix it with the concept to design something. I am not a guy who flaunts my educational qualifications on social media. You are most welcome to assume whatever you like. But all you have said so far has been contradicting yourself. You say science and religion have no connection and then go ahead and try to relate them in the next paragraph.\n\n>Some of you get frustrated when someone even connects Islam and progress as a historical example like I did but I bet you nod along when some foreign media connects islam with terrorism.\n\nIf there is a valid point I don\'t think anyone will get frustrated. If you forcefully try to connect two things that aren\'t remotely close people will always come back with questions. That\'s why the society progressed, because they questioned the authority.

I still remember one particular incident. When I was in Lahore, I used to take bus number 19 and go straight to Data Darbar to meet my ustad in the bazaar there. I remember it was a hot afternoon. It was around 2 p.m. when I jumped on the bus and went to the top floor . . . it was a doubledecker bus and there was only one other person sitting there. He looked at my sitar, which was wrapped in a cloth and asked what it was in Punjabi. I told him it was a baja (musical instrument) and he asked what I was doing with it. I said I was going to my ustad. He then wanted to know where I was from. By now I could sense that I was in trouble. When I told him I belonged to East Pakistan, he started saying “That’s why Bengalis are so bad. Instead of carrying a talwar, you have a baja in your hand.” I remember feeling ashamed and apologizing to him . . .*\n\nA Pakistani business family in Bangladesh ignores the pleas of one family member to move back to Pakistan before the war starts. The family member was the only one who could speak Bengali and had Bengali friends giving him a clearer understanding of what was happening and was one of the few Pakistanis interviewed for the book that expressed strong sympathies for Bangladeshis.\n\n*By that time I was done with my college, but my family was there. We had a large business there, so I had no reason to leave. But, yes, I could feel the pulse of the people and I would often tell my family to sell everything and move away. They would laugh at me. I remember my uncle saying, “If one fires a pistol here, you will not see a single Bengali from [Dhaka] to Chittagong. They will all run away. They are a cowardly nation.” They actually believed that. I would keep telling them to move to Lahore, to go back to West Pakistan, but they wouldn’t listen.’ Asif’s uncle’s confidence that the Bengalis would never be successful in forming an independent nation was matched by many of the people I had interviewed in Pakistan. They told me that they never imagined that Pakistan would lose the war, that there would ever be a chance of Bengalis having their way, creating their own country. In the popular imagination, they were seen as meek, powerless, lacking courage, as the ‘non-martial’ race. There was no reason to sell one’s business and leave because the Bengalis were no real threat in their eyes. [...] Later, when we lost everything—houses, property, cars, trucks, you name it—my uncles conceded that I had been right the whole time. They said, “Yaar, tu theek hi kehta tha [You were so right].” But they never listened to me then . . .*', 'Fun fact: Bengalis as a ""non-martial race"" was a myth that was perpetuated by the British after the East India company was nearly upended during the Sepoy Mutiny (many if not most of the muntineering sepoys were Bengalis).', 'Thanks for sharing this.
