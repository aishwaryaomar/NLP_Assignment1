"BLM protestors heard about some of the bigoted things he said in his lifetime and decided to spray paint ""was a racist"" on one of his statues. The fact that his reputation is getting tarnished for anything other than being directly responsible for the Bengal famine of 1943 is proof that there's no justice in the world.
