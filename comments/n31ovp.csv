"Haat diye bhaat khowar mojai aladha. Tried eating with chopsticks, fork and knife. Shanti lagge na re Bhai, shanti lagge na. I once had a friends mom say ""You guys eat with your hands? that's disgusting! You will not be eating with your hands in my house."" I asked her, How do you eat your Burger, Pizza and Fried Chicken? That shut her up real quick.",34,t3_n31ovp,0,1619973351.0

">	In 1075 the Venetian doge married a byzantine princess named Theodora who travelled to Venice with a large dowry containing, among other things, golden forks. The Catholic church when they saw this ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù tool forbade its use as it was an affront to God. God had given us fingers to eat, not using them was considered a sin. ‚ÄúGod in his wisdom has provided man with natural forks‚Äîhis fingers. Therefore it is an insult to him to substitute artificial metal forks for them when eating‚Äù. As a consequence, forks were not be seen again for another 300 years in Europe but by the 1400s they start to appear again in Italian households.

"It‚Äôs not the whole story, it was just a source to talk about how the church objected. In reality the fork was most likely introduced to Europe via Sicily which was an arab emirate at the time. There‚Äôs many many retellings of the story online and in history books.",1,t1_gwtd8fo,4,1620071820.0
