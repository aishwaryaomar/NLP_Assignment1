"The title lol. Anyway great drawing,specially for a 15yo like the other comment said don't let his parents waste his talent. The kid clearly has a future in arts",31,t3_qlyme3,0,1635960057.0
"I need you to support him. Families, schools, people they do nothing but discourage and devalue artists. For a teen with very little confidence, he might end up stopping this and let go of his talent. He needs inspiration and support.",25,t3_qlyme3,0,1635963376.0
Please don't let him and his talents be sacrificed to daktari and engineering. He sounds depressed tho vis-a-vis the self confidence.,39,t3_qlyme3,0,1635959548.0

Great work! Hope your cousin keeps it up.,10,t3_qlyme3,0,1635963762.0
"Well its evident that your cousin is talented by birth, the drawing is beautiful.

Same issue with my best friend, he has God given talent in drawing & creativity till the time we were kids, nobody taught him anything, but he never practices diligently and tries to improve. If I was him I would have bet everything on my talent and would have become world class Artist. It just pains me to see his talent not being utilized.

I would suggest your cousin to accept that he has the talent in himself and look inside him seriously to  decide if he wants to improve further. Cause he still has much to improve and even talented people needs hard work to truly reach their potential.",7,t3_qlyme3,0,1635994059.0
">makes me want to beat him with a ঝারু until he decides to respect himself for the person he is

Tough love eh? Good on you for posting his work. He should know his worth and he's definitely showing it here.

Hey man. I've met a lot of people like this. Let me give you a slightly different perspective. After confronting some of them as to why they are constantly self ridiculing they have admitted that sometimes it's not a  serious thing. It may be a tactic to gain attention. Having self doubt and low self esteem can be worked on but if you give suggestions and the person constantly puts them down giving you one sob story after another you know what to do.,1,t3_qlyme3,0,1635979797.0
