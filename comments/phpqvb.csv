Dont you think this quote is unsuitable for a country’s armed force? Pretty dumb imo.,9,t3_phpqvb,0,1630816641.0
"That's the dumbest quote to have on any National Army page, imo. The Army of any country is not just brute force like an automatic gun... It's much more about tactics and discipline.

This quote would have suited much more on the webpage of a terrorists group, or on the page of a security company (by a long shot). Not on something as civilized as represented by a proud nation's Army.

Esit: It's more along the veins of saying ""Join Bangladesh Jongi"", if I'm being honest.",35,t3_phpqvb,0,1630776248.0

"> or on the page of a security company 

I'm inclined to give you credit for bringing this point in the context of the peacekeeping missions that are carried out (mind you, they are paid for it as contract work).

 It does come across as a poorly chosen slogan to recruit, but I do no disagree with the slogan itself. The pen and sword both are important tools (diplomacy and the threat of violence) to maintain one's sovereignty both as an individual and nation. 

 Having said that, we have a very uneasy relationship with violence (in our culture). The military machine ideally helps direct and develop this sense into a more organized manner (ideally) but unfortunately that becomes a 'hammer for every job' kind of situation. The best armies in the world use every tool at their disposal. 

A personal favorite quote from Jim Mattis can shed light: 
""Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everyone you meet.""

But he's also said this: 
“If you haven't read hundreds of books, you are functionally illiterate, and you will be incompetent, because your personal experiences alone aren't broad enough to sustain you.”

"I went to Mirzapur Cadet College in 2017, so things may have changed since then. I am not sure what you mean by ""clarify"" since there are dozens of things, but I will give you the philosophical issues with the army system.

The most predominant philosophy at Cadet was the idea that your group comes before yourself. So if you're doing drills in a group of 20, if ONE of you messes up, ALL 20 of you have to do the entire drill again. 

The 2nd thing is the completely bullshit rules just for ""discipline"". You are forced to shower in the morning in cold water even if you don't want to (btw there's no hot water even in the winter). You're also not allowed to do ANYTHING outside of the specific time slots allocated for said activities. So, if you have an exam coming up and you want to study instead of playing sports, you're not allowed to.

These are just some of them that are related to discipline. There's also a lot of bullying and ragging by the seniors, while the school authority does nothing about it.",7,t1_hbmry1w,3,1630803518.0
