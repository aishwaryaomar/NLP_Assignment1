"Thanks man
Honestly i dont do digital arts that much 
This is just only one of the three i ever did in my life.
I usually do logos for clients and posters for my college clubs.
And its been somewhat more than a year",1,t1_gv066vi,1,1618782050.0
So i used sketchbook to draw this and its okay to have doubts about it. Everyone has an opinion,0,t1_gv0ibvl,1,1618782997.0

Yeah. I am just getting into digital art a little bit. But takes too long to finish anything. What is your technique?,1,t1_guz1nne,4,1618757306.0
"Time. Take lots amd lots of time. Made something you didnt like? Erase the part you hate and start over that part again until you make it perfect.
Im a HSC candidate so time isnt my friend either, but whatever projects you make be aure to take your time.",3,t1_guz1t3r,5,1618757433.0
"Yeah, takes too long. I would copy some image from the net and construct a wire frame. Then do a color layer. Then put a outline layer on top. Works well. Mostly focused on humanoid. Going to start landscape. Youtube tutorials help a lot.",3,t1_guz21t9,6,1618757602.0
"Definetly.
I usually create a rough wire frame with the line tool and then use a brush",3,t1_guz2df0,7,1618757674.0
