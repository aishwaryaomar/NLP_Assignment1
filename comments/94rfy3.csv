Plus, blow up your own country's news teams so they would feel some pressure to get on top of this .

It will just foster the illusion of having done something and fill us with a sense of self righteousness. Directly contacting politicians at this stage will only result in apathy without having gained a platform for these incidents on mainstream media first.

You need to contact the South Asian news desks for all the MSM outlets. It needs to gain traction with local reporters and go up the ladder for the respective agencies before they splash it all over their main pages.

Reuters, AFP, BBC, Al-J and the like all have regional subdivisions with local reporters...it’s them who need to be tweeted at, not the organisation at the top level.

Also try non traditional media. These events are bread and butter for the folks behind Vice News, Daily Show, John Oliver, Samantha Bee, Jim Jeffries, The Last Leg with Adam Hills and other socially conscious satirists of their ilk. They may help give you more exposure.

You need momentum in the media before any external politician or political organisation will step up and say anything. Before even talking about the UN or EU, you have your SAARC, GCC and ASEAN closer by who may be persuaded to say something first.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—

"Two students died in a bus race that had nothing to do with the government. The government can make regulations (which is certainly lacking) but abiding to it is on drivers. Both drivers were arrested. The roads are bad because ex PM Khaleda Zia and her son siphoned off trillions of Taka. During her 5 year tenure in 01-06 Bangladesh was number 1 in whole world in corruption for 5 straight years.

The agitation was made violent as soon as Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chatra Dal the student wing of Khaleda Zia's BNP joined. JCD has a history of violence and murder not only amongst its faction but is generally a radical Islam supporter and  supported the many killings of secular bloggers and vloggers in Bangladesh. BNP itself is a rabid anti secular party and very very religious. Khaleda follows the footsteps of her dictator husband. Don't forget Jamaat-e-islami a nefarious hardcore Islamic political party who does not believe in secularism. It's student wing is known for bomb attacks and machete killings. It has also committed war crimes during Bangladesh independence fight of 1971. It's leader once boasted of killing 1000 Biharis by himself in a single day. It's student wing Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir supports shariat and supports only madrassa education. In February 2014, US-based defense think tank IHS Jane's published a report titled ""IHS Jane's 2013 Global Terrorism & Insurgency Attack Index"", where Shibir(Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir) ranked third in a list of most active non-state armed groups in 2013.

Every minister has urged students to either go back to classes or be in home. Do accidents not happen in any other part of the world? Bangladesh has a good judicial system. Grievances could have been directed there. It's not like bangladesh is a rich country with surplus budget. 

This agitation is nothing more than a ploy by opposition to sway the democratic election which are to be held later this year. It's politics on dead bodies(*Laash pe rajneeti karna*). The BNP and Jamaat both supported terrorist and militancy in India supporting the ULFA, NSCN (I-M), PLA and other Manipuri outfits found a safe haven in Bangladesh not only morally but financing and giving them living quarters after attack on India.

According to the Saudi authorities, Khaleda Zia and her sons had an investment of around $12 billion in malls and other infrastructural projects in Saudi Arabia with the money amassed through bribery and extortion. As investigations are underway, more facts have surfaced about huge investments by the BNP chief's late son Arafat alias Koko, who died in January 2015. Koko allegedly made enormous investments in Saudi Arabia - all from ill-gotten wealth. He was also wanted in Bangladesh for multiple charges of corruption. Similarly, his brother Tareq Rahman, now in hiding in England, invested several millions of dollars in many foreign destinations with a large chunk of sum in Saudi Arabia and other West Asian countries. Earlier, there were allegations, many supported by evidence, that Tareq had nefarious dealings, including money-laundering and large investments, with the underworld dons, detrimental to Indian security interests.

"Thanks for replying, you must be really busy managing this important post.

Did you contact at the top level or individual regional divisions? Top level will ignore you. The reporters designated with South Asia may actually do something. Most reporters have their own twitter handles anyway.

They may not respond to you individually, but they will investigate if more people contact them...this is where the power of Reddit can come alive and actually make a difference. 

If someone puts the regional news desk or reporter contact info for the various MSM on your ‘how you can help’ post near the top, then chances are more Redditors will pop them a tweet or email. It will gain traction if you make it easier for Redditors and soon those news desks will be overwhelmed by all the messages. Maybe even a draft message to copy paste, or a link to your evidence archive.

"Hey! I too also live in the United States but am a concerned Bangladeshi. 

Basically a week ago two school bus drivers in Bangladesh were racing against each other to pick up their passengers. In their race they ended up killing two students. This already sparked outrage at the lack of people that follow the traffic laws; but insensitive comments from our shipping minister Shajahan Khan who is also president of the Road Transport Federation fueled the fire and millions of students took to the streets to protest for the past week. 

The protests were peaceful and there was no intention of violence. These kids were educating drivers on the streets on traffic law, checking if drivers had their licenses, creating lanes for different vehicles, etc. Doing things that our government should have done years ago. Instead of fixing the problem, the government (currently ruled by the Awami League) retaliated yesterday by firing rubber bullets and tear gas at the students. Hundred of terrified girls were kept hostage by the government and police in buildings they took refuge in. Four students died and four girls were allegedly raped. Hundreds more injured, and some aren’t even able to get treated now because the government has threatened retaliation against the doctors/nurses. 

A lot have now took to social media to share pictures and videos as an outcry for help. The Bangladeshi government is censoring everything on the local news and Facebook and YouTube are taking down anything related to the events. The Bangladeshi government have also recently taken away mobile internet in an attempt to hide what they are calling “fake news”. 

And all this because some kids wanted to help people follow traffic laws to make Bangladesh a better place.",166,t1_e3nl1y9,3,1533490625.0

">Where is the iPhone client? Terrible idea.

Blame Apple for not wanting an actually secure mesh messaging system on their platform. :)

It definitely ISN'T a terrible idea to use a more secure client between Android phones and avoid using FireChat as much as it makes sense, but no further. I didn't say to ignore it entirely. My point: Briar ought to get a lot more encouragement than FireChat and that people who point out FireChat should also point out the security risks associated with it, and to neglect doing so seems like an actually terrible idea.

>still holds true for other FOSS applications.

1. You likely didn't intend it, but the way you wrote that sentence, it implies that FireChat is FOSS (Free Open Source Software). It's not, it is proprietary software, Briar is not.

2. Let me go over the issues addressed in the article one by one:

>>However, an individual within one of the mesh networks could easily snoop on nearby users' discussions because all conversations are conducted in open chatrooms.

This doesn't hold true for Briar, Mesh network traffic is already encrypted.

>What's more, the app does not facilitate private, one-to-one messaging and also doesn't use any kind of encryption to protect messages in transmission. 

This doesn't hold true for Briar, everything is encrypted.

>It doesn't change anything, the governemnt can access them as well. 
That sounds like [FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt). The government almost certainly CAN'T access anything written via Briar.

>Assuming Google will not sentence many people to death

...seriously? Wind down your hyperdramatic rhetoric a bit, please.

Assuming Google will not sentence many people to death, it's an absolutely terrible idea to switch to something that doesn't work on both Android and iOS.

"**Mesh networking**

A mesh network (or simply Meshnet) is a local network topology in which the infrastructure nodes (i.e. bridges, switches and other infrastructure devices) connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data from/to clients. This lack of dependency on one node allows for every node to participate in the relay of information. Mesh networks dynamically self-organize and self-configure, which can reduce installation overhead.

"**Fear, uncertainty and doubt**

Fear, uncertainty and doubt (often shortened to FUD) is a disinformation strategy used in sales, marketing, public relations, politics, cults, and propaganda. FUD is generally a strategy to influence perception by disseminating negative and dubious or false information and a manifestation of the appeal to fear.

While the phrase dates to at least the early 20th century, the present common usage of disinformation related to software, hardware and technology industries generally appeared in the 1970s to describe disinformation in the computer hardware industry, and has since been used more broadly.

It is our job to hold these companies accountable for their actions! As the consumers we have the ultimate power! It’s about fucking time we started using it! I wish I had accounts on Facebook and Twitter just for this purpose. We need to stop complaining and start doing something!

"**“Hope” is the thing with feathers** - *Emily Dickinson*

“Hope” is the thing with feathers 

That perches in the soul 

And sings the tune without the words 

And never stops - at all 

And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard 

And sore must be the storm 

That could abash the little Bird

That kept so many warm 

I’ve heard it in the chillest land 

And on the strangest Sea 


Yet - never - in Extremity,

It asked a crumb - of me.
