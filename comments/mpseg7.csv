"If japan can afford to live with earthquake each day, why not us? Maybe we can't find a way to get rid of this calamity right away. But 2050 is a long time to do something to reduce flood on our land. But government should have a plan and intension to work for it. 

Most of the floods happen just because of Indian water. We know the reason. What we need is to act to solve it.",5,t3_mpseg7,0,1618296865.0

"Bangladesh in the past was a lot bigger. We used to control Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.

The land was lost because of colonialism and given away to the Indians. So now the sea rise is an existential threat.",4,t3_mpseg7,0,1618292687.0

Iâ€™ve been thinking about a solution - to auto-outsource the development and give planning voting rights directly to public. Financing will be a mixture of Bangladeshi retail/private and general institutional (international probably) investors. This will be a fully transparent model to ramp Bangladesh to one of the most attractive countries to live and sustain a competitive economy in the world. The infrastructure will be climate/natcat hazards defensive,1,t3_mpseg7,0,1618385390.0

Bangladesh was never that big. You're talking about the bengal sultanate. Bangladesh is not the new bengal sultanate.,7,t1_gucbvw2,1,1618307499.0

Lot of the farm land near coastal areas are experiencing high amount of salt water. Now. Paddy farmer are opting out and digging pools to produce shrimp in salt water. This is happening in slow pace. The arsenic issue is also related to low river water flow.,2,t1_gucfrti,1,1618329617.0

I know brother. Its insane to compare the overall economy of BD with Japan. Im not doing so. I am pointing at overcoming an obstacle. Japan is earthquake prone country and they are comfortable with it now. We have scope of improving the flood condition too if we could well negotiate with india.,1,t1_guck03z,2,1618314650.0
"Yes you can't compare Japan's economy with us, japan is a member of G7 for god's sake. But we can compete with vietnam. Our economy is almost as strong as theirs. I think only their per capita income is higher than ours, but even then our per capita growth rate is higher. Their economy currently relies VERY heavily on FDI and exports and this is very dangerous for any economy because FDIs are very prone to sudden shifts.",1,t1_guck03z,2,1618308671.0

"And do you think the garment industry and remittance are very secure? This two-sector is keeping Bangladesh alive and both of them are not sustainable in the future, automation is coming and it's coming hard, western companies take a lot of shit because of the slave laborers in this two industry and they'll wanna move from that as soon as they can, so we need other plans or we're screwed too.",3,t1_gucsjcd,3,1618322443.0

Hereâ€™s your answer http://bangladeshembassy.nl/bangladesh-delta-plan-2100/,1,t1_guc56fg,3,1618288910.0
"Remittance is not stable, never has been. A majority of the remittances goes to family members, which means most of it is used for consumption and not production. Garment sector is actually quite stable, much more than FDI. FDI is very volatile but that doesn't mean it's bad, it actually promotes technological exchanges between countries. The reliance on any one sector is bad though, more so if the sector you're relying on is that volatile. Yes, we are relying on garments a lot as well, but policies to diversify our economy has been taken. That doesn't guarantee diversification, but it's still a step in the right direction. When it comes to economy all the government can do is enact smart policies that supports local businesses, the rest depends on the people. And about automation, they've been trying to automate garments industry for a long time, the nature of the work makes it very hard to automate, it's easier for robots to work with hard pieces of metals than it is to work with malleable cloths. And western companies never cared about slave labours, when people act up they launch a PR campaign and then keep doing what they were doing. Research a bit about the ""environment friendly"" fashion lines of these western companies, you will soon find out that all they do is make a pretty ad and then stick a  environment friendly label on them.",1,t1_guddmou,4,1618327769.0
