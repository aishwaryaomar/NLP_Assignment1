"People who aren’t ignorant know that Bangladesh exists, trust me. 10 years ago I would agree with you. If you look up on yt “American dumb test” you’re gonna see that they are literally ignorant about the existence of popular EU countries, let alone Bangladesh.

"People knows because, your get server closer to our country. You are playing with people around Bangladesh. Of course they'd know about us. But to be fair, Bangladesh has not done anything remarkable to be recognized.",1,t1_h4hq7iu,2,1625804196.0

"Yeah no. I don’t play bogus mobile games like pubgm or free fire, I play games that have servers based in Singapore, UAE, or NA depending on the game. Of course Asian people will recognise us better, but it’s wrong in 2021 to say that no one knows Bangladesh exists.",6,t1_h4k1597,3,1625804342.0

"You were quick to judge! I was not talking about mobile games either, in fact I wasn't even thinking about mobile games. I strictly game on PC. Anyway, my point was, Bangladesh has not done anything remarkable to get an acknowledgement. So I am not surprised people still doesn't know about us, especially if they are Europeans.

I have been living in Germany for the past 2.5 years. People usually recognizes us with something associated with either Cricket or India or with something bad that we have done (which I am not proud of, I stopped telling people that I am from Bangladesh unless it's necessary, they now assume I am Indian or something). And pretty much 30% - 40% of my teammates never even heard the name when I que matches from here, just like you never heard of that random african country. I wouldn't label it as ignorance to be honest.",1,t1_h4k1djz,4,1625804625.0
"Well, how many countries, out of 180 countries do you think have done anything remarkable? I would place the tag on EU countries, some South American countries, the Asian tigers and of course Uncle Sam. There are a lot more countries that people with basic geography knowledge do not know the existence of, I would say the same for Bangladesh maybe 10 years back but I feel like we have been doing good as a country to get recognition overall. But we can agree to disagree 👊",3,t1_h4k1t78,5,1625804873.0
