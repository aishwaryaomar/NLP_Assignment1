"When there's rainfall in Dhaka, the water is essentially trapped on the surface as the city relies entirely on its sewer system  which does not have the capacity for it. The other problem is Dhaka is completely built over. No seriously. How much space has been dedicated to green spaces in the city? Not much compared to other cities. Hell if you look at individual properties in Dhaka, the entire lot is covered with buildings and roads. Theres absolutely zero green space. Someone at city hall forgot to put a law in place that made property developers set aside a portion of a lot for grass, trees and other plants.",20,t3_ntjpih,0,1622987355.0
