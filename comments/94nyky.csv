"That poor woman. I hope the Bangladeshi Hitler's Youth gets whats coming to them. Completely horrible that they could do something like this to another human being just because they got the green light from some authority figures they follow like mindless drones. Be strong, and keep getting information out. This is your weapon.",214,t3_94nyky,0,1533435635.0
The reason they do this is so women are discouraged from taking part in these protests and parents will pressure their daughters to stay away from them.,25,t3_94nyky,0,1533493275.0
"Jesus fucking christ. I have no idea what to say. I just found out about what's going on in Bangladesh but I am powerless just like the others. Only way I can is by spreading awareness which has already been done. Doing it nonetheless.

"> I hope the Bangladeshi Hitler's Youth gets whats coming to them. 

The government has hired men (thugs) to do this. It's pretty important to not put this all on the students. This happened a ton in Burma - the government hires men to assault protesters and then tries to say the hired men were some other group.",30,t1_e3mjsy0,1,1533459699.0
"I may be reading this wrong, and correct me if i am by all means, but are you saying rape is how you convince woman to stay at home? I'm sure there are a few earlier steps you can take you know? ",1,t1_e3np5hl,1,1533548684.0

Tried posting it onto /r/videos but it was taken down for its political context. Appealing to a mod to make an exception in light of the gravity of the situation. I truly hope you are okay.,65,t1_e3mjv5y,2,1533437324.0

"Seriously, fuck the mods who remove the videos. 

This situation requires as much awareness as possible. I think they can allow videos with political context for the time being. ",49,t1_e3mlalx,3,1533481004.0
The moment they remove that rule the sub will be flooded with anti-Trump videos.,13,t1_e3nd2ti,4,1533501873.0
A video can be of something trivial or it can be of something which can be viewed in terms of politics. There is nothing between.,7,t1_e3nd2ti,4,1533487516.0
