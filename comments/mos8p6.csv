"It’s based on the old British system. Very Victorian. Learn by Rota, which was okay back then as the civil service was run by learned administrators, but now we have computers, IT processes, we should be upskilling the education for modern times.",8,t3_mos8p6,0,1618168540.0

"One thing is health ministry in BD should be run by a scientist kind of person. Not a doctor. Or else that person will end up rooting for doctor lobbies. They are already powerful. 

The education minister is actually one of the most educated person in cabinet. Kahini hoito oikhanei i dont know.  I actually like the deputy(?) edu minister guy.",-1,t1_gu6daj3,1,1618199405.0

"you got a point but at least one should be appointed according to the subjects they have some knowledge in, our Minister of Road Transport and Bridges is a political science student, he won't know much about road planning and it's natural, likewise everyone in our cabinet are educated but not appointed in their field of expertise, so that knowledge is just going to waste more or less, but look at our agriculture minister, he's appointed according to his field of expertise, and somewhat our agriculture sector is comparatively more stable than other sectors.",1,t1_gu7wl6p,2,1618209231.0

"I mean.... if you really want a ""good"" education, then british curriculum is also shit \~ maybe a little less. But shit is shit either way. I would suggest you to drop off and see if you can manage to get homeschooled and start reading good books. Essentially the only way you can learn some subject is by reading a good book/good stuff/handout/paper I mean you get the point right.  
Anecdote, covid has literally given you the chance to be essentially homeschooled. And by the time you go to college, you can switch to some ""shorkari college"" where you are not required to go to college everyday and basically continue your stuff.  
Yeah, it all boils down to how hard you can gamble and still make it work. Society has fouled you, but you gotta keep playing! GL!",3,t1_gu6beak,4,1618349642.0
