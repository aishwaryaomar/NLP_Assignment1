"> Based on trials by many street medics, this is one recommendation for exposure to pepper spray, especially for the mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth, genitalia)

> Eyeflush
Example of LAW eye wash, from training workshop.

 > L.A.W. is a solution of half liquid antacid and half water. This only applies to aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide based antacids such as Maalox (plain, NOT mint, as it burns.). Please note that simethicone based antacids have NOT used in trials so far, and therefore are not recommended (however, simethicone as a secondary ingredient in Maalox has not been shown to cause harm.) Products like milk of magnesia and pepto bismol are NOT recommended.",57,t3_94t6bk,0,1533489449.0
"DO NOT USE WATER to washout any pepper spray on your skin or in your eyes — that only makes you feel worse and it might bring the chemical substances into your eyes. Use dry paper towel to gently absorb the pepper spray, but do not wipe it out as it would spreads the pepper spray, and remember to change to a new paper towel constantly.

Milk is a good counter for those who do get pepper sprayed. It’s worked for me in the past. ,12,t3_94t6bk,0,1533499174.0
What? I worked in law enforcement and they recommend using water to wash out your eyes. I can't help but think this is bad advice.,17,t1_e3nqygn,1,1533513618.0
"I don't know about pepper spray so can not say but tear gas is an aerosol, ie solid molecules suspended within a harmless gas. The solid molecules react with moisture such as sweat or the moisture in your eyes to produce the painful gas which actually hurts you, which is why a water soaked rag round your mouth is helpful, as the molecules react to the moisture on the rag rather than being drawn in to the body and reacting to the moisture in your mouth and lungs.

If it's tear gas you're facing then there is no way a dry cloth is going to clear all of those solid molecules that were suspended in the gas, they will be clinging to your eyelashes, hiding in wrinkles of skin, etc.

A technique for clearing tear gas which I have used before goes like this:

* 1 - Get the patient to hold their breath then quick wash over the face, particularly hair such as eyebrows or beard. This first all over wash is to bring the molecules stuck to the patient's face in to contact with liquid, forcing them to expend their gas. 
* 2 - Get the patient to kneel in front of you with eyes tightly closed and saturate their eyes with water. The aim is to ensure the eyelashes and wrinkles in the skin around the eyes are cleansed as this is where the aerosol molecules will be hiding.
* 3 - With the area around the eye clean you can now start irrigating the eye itself. Tears will naturally flow from the inside of the eye to the outside so follow the same path. With eyes open use a bottle of water, pour it from the nose out towards the side of the face so the water is following the path of their tears.
* Note - Even for an experienced medic it is often best to get the patient to perform step 3 themselves. Eyes are delicate and the patient will know better than you how much water they need to clear their eye.

Best of luck and may the situation be resolved to help all. There is the heart of a Scottish wildcat with you even if I lack the means to join you in body.",6,t1_e3nqygn,1,1533526238.0
Milk or malox will ease the pain as well,3,t1_e3nqygn,1,1533517683.0

"As someone who has been sprayed, and is in law enforcement, this advice is terrible. Wash it off, dry it off, and wait. Only time will help, and the clock doesn't start until it's completely off of you.",19,t1_e3o9dfp,2,1533517124.0
"Well, considering I was getting fucked by the government and it was by police in, I’ll be sure to keep that in mind. Thank you.",3,t1_e3ow127,2,1533597821.0
