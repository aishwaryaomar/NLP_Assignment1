"I grew up in the U.S, my family came here in the 90‚Äôs. There weren‚Äôt a lot of Bangladeshis here in NYC while I was growing up and honestly I felt like it was alot better then.

My family was somewhat religious, we got along with our non Muslim-non Bangladeshi neighbors. Most of the Bangladeshis came though visa program. That program ended in the mid 2000‚Äôs and then more Bangladeshis came through chain migrations. A LOT more religious and conservative Bangladeshis who hate the culture here, and I felt life in general hasn‚Äôt been the same. More conservative religious values became common. Facebook just made it worse. I have family back in bangladesh who celebrated when the taliban taking over and complain all day about the U.S but will be coming here soon. I‚Äôm not looking forward to it. I wouldn‚Äôt want ANY Bangladeshi of that mentality to come here. 

I‚Äôm fully open to open minded more liberal folks coming here, but the conservative ones are making the community here even worse and are creating problems within families as most of the American born Bengalis hate those conservative ideologies. I personally am planning on leaving NYC to another state soon for those very reason and I know many younger, well educated Bengalis who feel the same way.",3,t3_u6z66k,0,1650409789.0

"Yeah, the reason people pick other places it not because it's liberal but because it is less corrupt.

In Bangladesh, every local police officer wants a bribe. Every small business skips on tax. Politicians line their pockets. Universities show nepotism and enrol family friends.

Corruption and poor pay is why people want to move to Canada or USA. And that they can already speak English. Not because they want to have purple fringe haircuts and go to Mardi Gras.",6,t3_u6z66k,0,1650400028.0

"Why are liberals so dumb... This meme wants to highlight how some people hates western values but still wants to move there. Which is understandable. But that does not mean adopting the western value but talking smack about it simultaneously is hypocritical . Westerners just have better education and jobs, not moral compass. So if a person does move to one only for those specific reasons but does not adopt their values is not a hypocrite. But a person who does js

Again people wants to move to western society to get better jobs and education. Not support the LGBTQ, and maybe settle there but what's wrong with that? People live in Bangladesh but complain about the law and so does the immigrant Bangladeshis in those societies(To themselves) . Atleast most of them...
 
 And also why do people in this sub reddit hate on Muslims and sharia law so much? Oh the islamists? Wow, they certainly are following the teachings and definitely aren't wrong. Man you guys are so baseless. Do some research smh

I'm not making fun of this meme or undermining it or anything, but the liberals crying about islamists. Which arguably both are assertive. But I say that Bangladeshi liberals are ruining what this country stands for, seriously they do. Bangladesh is supposed to see each other as brother and sister no matter what religion. Not attack each other for what they do and don't believe and force a certain agenda. So islamists and liberals are the same, except the islamists are more assertive as one may say. 

Also, the west are way more brutal than any Islamists ever, just look at israel and Palestine. Not to mention the west themselves ignoring their own teachings..(Israel) 

We love democracy? And protesting is OK? Nope kill Iraqis in fallujah for peacefully protesting and basically don't allow them to choose what they want to do but do it yourselves. 

Don't force anyone anything because that's anti-democratic? Cancel anyone not supporting the LGBTQ

Be against all forms of oppression? Nope let's oppress people ourselves and make them look like terrorists but let's show support to the white guys",4,t3_u6z66k,0,1650401392.0

"Their advancement in science and technology is based on their ‚Äúmorals, ethics and values‚Äù. Shall we go over how they have come to such technological advancements? Let‚Äôs take recent examples in medicine: the Henrietta Lacks fiasco, embryological gene manipulation, human experiments performed by Klingman, Zimbardo, Milgram, Sherif and many more. All these unethical practices have led to scientific breakthroughs that has helped humanity in some way or other. They have come at the cost of people in the west, people you look down on. So, in that regard, the science is not separate from western morals and you picking and choosing what is palatable for you within the confines of Islam is purely for your own benefit. It allows you to navigate a complex world without having to dissect reality and acknowledge the sacrifices of the western world. You don‚Äôt respect what these people have gone through and categorize them under a blanket term of ‚Äúunethical, immoral beings‚Äù. So far, you have only considered what you gain from them, but not what they have given up for you to have that advantage.

I am sure your views on ‚Äúimmorality‚Äù are based on how they treat LGBTQ people. While the western world‚Äôs history of morality has not been perfect, they acknowledge most of their mistakes and take steps to remedy the issues that have risen from faulty actions. We, on the other hand, still argue about child marriage and taking right away from people who have done nothing to harm others. It is hypocritical of you to think that eastern or Islamic values are somehow superior to western ones.

"I still don't understand how you are bringing moral values into science. Isn't science supposed to be free from all of that and be neutral ? And the progress in medicine you mentioned. Its not just that. Every single single human achievements and progress has dark past behind them.

And also why stop there ? Father of modern medicine is a Muslim guy. There are ethical , unethical, athiest, jews, christians, muslims, pagans etc. everyone's contribution to the knowledge and technology we have today and we all use daily. Scientific knowledge is not exclusively a result of western civilization or their own invention disconnected from everyone. Every single knowledge is based on the previous works of others from different parts of the world with different moral values. So its pretty childish to think that today's technological achievement is because of western values. 

Here is some interesting history to study for you. Learn how Muslims embraced philosophy-technology from the greeks, romans, persians and advanced human knowledge further that worked as the basis for the Renaissance later. 

And I think you also relating western quality of life with knowledge. Its the knowledge I am after which doesn't depend on their morality. Which is why thousands Muslims graduate from catholic schools and colleges in our country every year without converting to christianity. 

Lastly your comments on morality. Our morality is superior because it came directly from the creator. Not invented by any human. Its objective not subjective. I agree nuance is the key. Humans are terrible. But Islam's values and ethics are objective and eternal. Now existence of God and is Islam really God's rules are very different topics that requires lengthy discussions. Not gonna go there now. I just want to say your sense of morality is subjective. You subconsciously think that Islam's stance on many things are wrong and western stances are better. For example on LGBT. So why can't I think the same but in reverse that Islam's stance on it is right yours is wrong.

You mentioned the lives were affected to bring me those anti-biotics. Why does that matter. Isaac Newton was a christian. And I hate christianity. Does that mean I cant use his first law ?

sorry to say this but the more I read the more I feel like most of you so-called current-day progressive thinkers are ""Borolok baper arts pora chelemeye"" who think they know **Everything** after knowing **Something**. I mean I even told you to look for yourself. If you looked a bit you would have known. No, ""Science and Religion"" aren't connected, nor anyone's inventions but it was their identity that they were proud and somewhat vocal of it. I didn't personally know them but as someone who graduated from the same field as F.R.Khan who was known as the einstein of structural engineering, I have read about him. He performed Hajj and one of his last creations is the hajj terminal which he wanted to supervise personally cause he thought if any nonmuslim was in charge of the project they won't understand the islamic significance of it and it would be just a glass or concrete block in the desert. even somewhere he talked about the importance of knowledge/learning in islamic tradition (i don't remember the source).  
if you don't want to do some ""looking up"" just dont talk na. It would be much better. I myself am a pretty free thinker and not a hardcore religious but jesus it seems like you as well as some other people here can't register the simple thing that a person or a society can be religious and still be rich and scientifically knowledgable.

>who think they know Everything after knowing Something.

Sadly that seems to be you. You mentioned all these things about designing this and that, so if the same guy designed a Church would that mean christianity helped him in doing what he was doing? Understanding the concept of something you will design doesn't mean he did it from a sentimental point of view. And many muslim structures have been designed by non-muslims. This has literally nothing do with faith. You use your education and experience and mix it with the concept to design something. I am not a guy who flaunts my educational qualifications on social media. You are most welcome to assume whatever you like. But all you have said so far has been contradicting yourself. You say science and religion have no connection and then go ahead and try to relate them in the next paragraph.

If there is a valid point I don't think anyone will get frustrated. If you forcefully try to connect two things that aren't remotely close people will always come back with questions.
