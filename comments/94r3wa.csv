"**We need someone to contact the mods of /r/pics/ and ask them** to link to this subreddit in a sticky at the top of those (3 or more) huge threads.  This will send a lot of people here who can help out.   

Ask the mods to put something like this at the top in a sticky in each thread:   ""Go to r/bangladesh/ for the latest updates, how you can help out, and the live thread.""

Can someone with some time volunteer to set up a ""How you can Help"" thread?    

We need someone to be willing to edit the main text of the thread every now and then - just to organize the main ways to help. Maybe to be able to update it a few times a day.  

And then people can comment in that thread how they need help.  Or what is most urgent right now (such as how to contact Facebook and what to ask them).  We can all upvote the best requests for help to keep them at the top.  ",5,t3_94r3wa,0,1533468433.0

"I haven't seen anyone involved with this situation that is saying ""Let's topple the Bangladeshi Government"".

Crossposting to Pakistani subreddit might help the post get more attention aswell. We already had a thread go up top about the student protest. They may be a few upvote. But would help. ,4,t1_e3n457n,2,1533469641.0

Thank you!,1,t1_e3o4nod,2,1533508713.0
"Great.  

I suggest:  

Title of thread:  How You Can Help (Please Read)   

Then something like:  

We will use this thread to list ways people around the world can help the students and people in Bangladesh.  

That is enough to start with.   

Also, you can also add these two urgent needs we have right now (maybe format it better):  

- getting this thread upvoted and seen:   

>please lets all help get this post in the front page. we need international intervention now!   
>https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/94qb7m/bangladesh_government_is_at_war_with_its_children/  

And contacting Facebook, which is posted on the live thread (asking them to remove the listing of people's contact info and addresses.   Scroll down in the live thread, and info is there.   

You can just say ""We urgently need people to contact Facebook. See the live thread for details"".  

Anything you want to do is OK.
