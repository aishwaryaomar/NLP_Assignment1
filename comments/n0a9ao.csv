Ofc they will blurr it. He is the son of a very powerful individual who feeds the gov. Even the gov. is afraid to go against his father let alone a tv channel.,49,t3_n0a9ao,0,1619606554.0
"One of his brothers allegedly killed another Bashundhara employee, Sabbir back in 2006 for jealousy over a girl he liked. Everyone in the country knew about it, and that piece of shit most likely got away with murder, so nothing's going to happen here. People are victim blaming a minor. This lack of empathy and basic human decency is why people leave Bangaldesh.

"I know for a FACT this guy is in Dubai right now- he has the money and resources to avoid justice. 

I know Daily Star has been SUPER careful not to show/name victim and while I think this is an admirable policy- I also think that when the family comes out with her pictures/name and is WANTING for people to know her story so that she is not a nameless/faceless victim of the rich and powerful, it can be i portant for her to get justice by people knowing who she was (as long as it is with the permission of family). 

There is SUCH a power imbalance in this case- you‚Äôre talking about an alleged perpetrator who is one of the richest, most powerful, most well-connected people in Bangladesh. Getting justice is going to be extremely difficult without the public supporting her family and demanding transparency. 

I think her family is extremely brave to go forward- and I hope they get the justice they deserve.",3,t3_n0a9ao,0,1619682435.0
