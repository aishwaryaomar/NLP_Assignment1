"Oooo
Why they not wearing western style of open anf ""freedom"" clothes !!!
Why they wear their own cultural and religious clothing. Bloody Islam making people wear modest clothing !!! Me mad 


I wonder when these woke ex-muslims will realize the irony of their shitty opinions.",5,t1_grc6966,1,1616070033.0
"Lmao you prob werenâ€™t even born in Bangladesh you idiot so foh with your hateful bullshit. Most of these women are stronger individuals than youâ€™ll ever be, and most likely they chose to wear hijabs or any sort of head covering as they got older",2,t1_grc6966,1,1616066268.0
Guys look at her comment history and thereâ€™s several comments of her advocating for religious genocide and just mass genocide of Bangladeshi people. Yikes,1,t1_grc6966,1,1616066591.0
"Go cry about it in the west where you probably live. You probably have never stepped foot in Bangladesh in your life, and hopefully you never will.

"They mostly have a choice in society to wear what they want, no doubt you donâ€™t understand stand as youâ€™re just some foreign pseudo intellectual hoping to bash on people in our subreddit",2,t1_grc9ci0,3,1616066533.0
"If you get triggered by women wearing what they want , youâ€™re an idiot. Youâ€™re a fake progressive whoâ€™s trying to hide their bigotry towards women and Muslims behind some sort of facade that youâ€™ve built up online. Grow up kid",9,t1_grc8pds,3,1616066472.0
Hey your comment was little bit harsh...i am an athiest myself living in bangladesh for years now. None forces them to cover their head and they have brain to determine whats good for them.,2,t1_grc8pds,3,1616065868.0

You do realize head coverings have been present in south Asian cultures for years. Also no please stop your using dog whistles to take shots at Muslims and then playing victim. See itâ€™s not atheism and typical atheists thatâ€™s awful itâ€™s edgy pseudo intellectuals such as you and that girl Iâ€™m responding to who constantly have such edgy takes that are terrible,7,t1_grccrgh,5,1616067261.0
