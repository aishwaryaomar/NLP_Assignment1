"These waz guys are selling a perverted form of Islam at least some of them cant speak for everyone.

*Indeed, those who disbelieve and commit wrong \[or injustice\] ‚Äì never will Allah forgive them, nor will He guide them to a path.¬†Except for the path of Hell; they will abide therein forever. And that, for Allah, is \[always\] easy. ‚Äì (Surah Nisa, verse 168, 169)*

## But Who Will Enter The Hell First?

According to a hadith, the¬†first three people whom Allah will call to send them to the hell will be a scholar, a martyr, and a wealthy man. The hadith is as follows,

## The Martyr:

 O*n the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) say:*

*The first of people against whom judgment will be pronounced on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who died a martyr. He will be brought and Allah will make known to him His favors and he will recognize them. \[ The Almighty\] will say: And what did you do about them? He will say: I fought for you until I died a martyr. He will say: You have lied ‚Äì you did but fight that it might be said \[of you\]: He is courageous. And so it was said. Then he will be ordered to be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hell-fire.*

## The Scholar:

 \[Another\] will be a man who has studied \[religious\] knowledge and has taught it and who used to recite the Quran. He will be brought and Allah will make known to him His favors and he will recognize them. \[The Almighty\] will say: And what did you do about them? He will say: I studied \[religious\] knowledge and I taught it and I recited the Quran for Your sake. He will say: You have lied ‚Äì you did but study \[religious\] knowledge that it might be said \[of you\]: He is learned. And you recited the Quran that it might be said \[of you\]: He is a reciter. And so it was said. Then he will be ordered to be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hell-fire. 

&#x200B;

## The Richman:

 *\[Another\] will be a man whom Allah had made rich and to whom He had given all kinds of wealth. He will be brought and Allah will make known to him His favors and he will recognize them. \[The Almighty\] will say: And what did you do about them? He will say: I left no path \[untrodden\] in which You like money to be spent without spending in it for Your sake. He will say: You have lied ‚Äì you did but do so that it might be said \[of you\]: He is open-handed. And so it was said. Then he will be ordered to be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hell-fire.¬† ‚Äì***(Sahih Muslim; Book #020, Hadith #4688)**

"Well, thats not really true, it only depends on who or where you ask. You have to critically analyse a situation in order to decide what is the best course of action religiously. If you question you faith, whether its true or not, you go ask someone educated to convince you or help ease your doubts surrounding your problem. Questions are mostly entertained, and they are answered. Sometimes though, you go to the wrong person and they advise you in the wrong way. Bangla Waaz is questionable ngl.

I'll be clear, I asked a question and he answered it and when I started questioning more, the mullah never got angry but was in fact happy I was asking questions. It was his entourage that took offence. He obviously calmed them down but I still got dirty looks and snarky remarks.",4,t1_ggiar5a,2,1608492683.0

"The process of 'deciding what's the best course of action religiously' is not the same thing as critically analysis. You will have to remove the word religiously and replace that with some other words like critically, rationally etc in order for that process to be considered critical analysis. You can think of critical analysis as the study of Philosophy. Religion has its basis in belief. Philosophy , on the other hand, is a critic of belief and belief systems. Philosophy subjects what some would be satisfied in believing to severe examination. Philosophy looks for rational explications and justifications for beliefs. 

Philosophy is about thinking critically about religion in all of its aspects. Thinking critically about religious beliefs might indicate that they are flawed in a number of ways: inconsistent, contradictory, without evidence to support the basic claims. This is why questions of critical nature are not entertained in religions. It's a common practice to do critical analysis in science study.

Philosophy has come to reveal that religious beliefs are just that beliefs and not empirical claims. Religious language is not ordinary language and certainly not scientific language.

I said that birthday is for celebrating that you are alive but if everyone believes it's for celebrating that your death is sooner and celebrate it as that then it's no use.

"Yeah, I don't agree with that sort of attitude people have, it should be fine to ask questions. Maybe they were concerned with time because I heard sometimes that's what happens? Or it could be the phrasing of the question, maybe they thought you didn't say it in a respectable way. 

I think if these waaz programs can have their benefits and drawbacks as well. On one hand, I find it better people spend their time watching it rather than something like drama serials. On the other hand, the main intention should be for education rather than entertainment from the perspective of the viewers. And for the people who host it, the idea of making a profit should not be their main intention either as I am hearing from other comments in this thread.",2,t1_ggibxl5,3,1608493339.0

"Yes, what you say is true, it is based off of belief. But the meaning of the most religious action can change depending on the scholar. For example, it may include using reasoning and critical thinking in a situation, and observing the best route while still complying with explicit religious commands, or it could mean strictly applying the religious texts alone, without using any reasoning or assessment of the situation per say. So in that case, ""religiously"" has a multitude of meanings that are debated by the scholars. Without digressing further, critical analysis can be applied within the constrictions of explicit and well defined religious commands. Also, you might want to know that only scholars that have received ijazah, or permission, are allowed to make legal opinions, not a layman. Of course, following the explicit and well defined religious commands and boundaries is a matter of faith, howsoever one obtained it.",1,t1_gjvv3le,3,1611130748.0
I think this is a result of not educating people correctly. I don't know what they were thinking that possibly showing disrespect to the Quran meant you would be burned.

"Honestly, I personally think I got the negative reception because the Mullah and I got along swimmingly.


I think they were envious that as a foreigner I could get close and ask such questions. 

After the Waaz I was invited on the mullah's table and ate with him. 

His English was better than my Bangla so we spoke in hybrid English/Sylheti.

Again I must reiterate the mullah was a very kind and understanding man. It was his entourage who were absolute cunts.

EDIT: Thinking about the encounter again, you are definitely right about how I phrased the questions. My Bangla is quite appalling so I definitely gave off vibes that I was being disrespectful because of the language I was using ie I referred to him as ""Tumi"" not ""Afnaa"".",3,t1_ggid82i,4,1608503775.0
