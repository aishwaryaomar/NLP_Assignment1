"Kazakhstan's currency is called the 'Tenge', and apparently it's meaning is related to scales (like balancing scale). The Tajiks apparently say it like _tanga_, and the word originates from Mongolic. I wonder if that might be related to our Taka.

This is what I got from Wikipedia:

>The word tenge in Kazakh and in most other Turkic languages means a set of scales (cf the old Uzbek tenga or the Tajik borrowed term tanga). The origin of the word is the Mongolic word teng (ᠲᠡᠩ) which means ""being equal, balance"". The name of this currency is thus similar to the pound, lira, peso, taka, and shekel. The name of the currency is related to the Russian word for money Russian: деньги/ den'gi, which the Old Russian language borrowed from Turkic sources.",9,t1_hklz32k,1,1636943814.0

"I doubt it. There are very few Turkic loanwords in Bengali in comparison to Persian and Arabic words. Taka is most probably derived from the Sanskrit word Tanka. However, it was standardized for the first time by the pre-Mughal Sultans of Bengal. Rupee/Rupiya also has origins in ancient India, but it was standardized by Sher Shah Suri in medieval times.",7,t1_hko6x3s,2,1636956191.0
