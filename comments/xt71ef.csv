"Some other passages that stood out to me:

A Bengali student studying in Pakistan is criticized by a Punjabi for carrying a sitar...

*. . . I still remember one particular incident. When I was in Lahore, I used to take bus number 19 and go straight to Data Darbar to meet my ustad in the bazaar there. I remember it was a hot afternoon. It was around 2 p.m. when I jumped on the bus and went to the top floor . . . it was a doubledecker bus and there was only one other person sitting there. He looked at my sitar, which was wrapped in a cloth and asked what it was in Punjabi. I told him it was a baja (musical instrument) and he asked what I was doing with it. I said I was going to my ustad. He then wanted to know where I was from. By now I could sense that I was in trouble. When I told him I belonged to East Pakistan, he started saying “That’s why Bengalis are so bad. Instead of carrying a talwar, you have a baja in your hand.” I remember feeling ashamed and apologizing to him . . .*

A Pakistani business family in Bangladesh ignores the pleas of one family member to move back to Pakistan before the war starts. The family member was the only one who could speak Bengali and had Bengali friends giving him a clearer understanding of what was happening and was one of the few Pakistanis interviewed for the book that expressed strong sympathies for Bangladeshis.

*By that time I was done with my college, but my family was there. We had a large business there, so I had no reason to leave. But, yes, I could feel the pulse of the people and I would often tell my family to sell everything and move away. They would laugh at me. I remember my uncle saying, “If one fires a pistol here, you will not see a single Bengali from [Dhaka] to Chittagong. They will all run away. They are a cowardly nation.” They actually believed that. I would keep telling them to move to Lahore, to go back to West Pakistan, but they wouldn’t listen.’ Asif’s uncle’s confidence that the Bengalis would never be successful in forming an independent nation was matched by many of the people I had interviewed in Pakistan. They told me that they never imagined that Pakistan would lose the war, that there would ever be a chance of Bengalis having their way, creating their own country. In the popular imagination, they were seen as meek, powerless, lacking courage, as the ‘non-martial’ race. There was no reason to sell one’s business and leave because the Bengalis were no real threat in their eyes. [...] Later, when we lost everything—houses, property, cars, trucks, you name it—my uncles conceded that I had been right the whole time. They said, “Yaar, tu theek hi kehta tha [You were so right].” But they never listened to me then . . .*",60,t3_xt71ef,0,1664661018.0

Athletic performance is a matter of state support and infrastructure not inherent ability. If we're using it to determine a community's inherent strength then no one in South Asia can claim to be martial given that countries like South Korea have won close to ~400 medals in the Olympics while India/Pakistan/Bangladesh/SriLanka collectively won ~60.
