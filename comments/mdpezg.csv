Be open I won't feel sad if you call us kafirs or something be real and frank though.

Edit answer to below threads
First of all 2002 was riot.
Search godra kand wherein muslim burned hindu pilgrimage for being kaafirs.
Secondly our stance towards bengal has always been positive, in 2016 we solved our 50 yr old border issue.
Third we are not against bengali people instead we admire you for your growth ,we are even taught how Bangladesh is turning out into manufacturing giant in South Asia.
We are against illigal immigrants.
Fourth if you hate modi because he is right wing, than you would surely hate Erdogan but that's not the case.

Besides in India Muslims are not safe. Your government is punishing Muslims anyways.
