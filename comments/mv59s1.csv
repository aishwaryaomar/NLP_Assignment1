Is there any way i can educate the people of my country on the benefits of wearing a mask? A workshop can also be organized.,2,t3_mv59s1,0,1619012948.0
Mask isn't 100% effective tho,1,t3_mv59s1,0,1618996462.0
But what is the surety that mask Isn‚Äôt wash & reuse? Corrupted people usually do such.,1,t3_mv59s1,0,1618995942.0

The tax to gdp ratio is too low. No one pays any tax and until that changes there won't be free universal healthcare.,3,t1_gvauig3,1,1619002872.0
"its possible in developed countrys like canada,saudi arabia,germany,australia.bd is still developing.itll be too expensive to make healthcare free. thats why corona tests still costs tk 70 rather than making it free.",2,t1_gvauig3,1,1618992436.0

people are scared to get sick there,2,t1_gvcac7n,2,1619027819.0
"Here's my thought:   In our country, rich private healthcare owners are capitalising by providing expensive treatment. So doctors incline to private sectors. Banning this hospital business and putting those greedy rich daddies on high tax is a way to develop our public medical sector. Their business is not helping anyone other than them anyway.

Moldova is a poor country with free healthcare. Cuba's socio-economy provides free developed healthcare which achieved better life expectancy than USA. Even after being so poor, Cuba health sector did something great(i forgot) related to curing cancer. Correct me if I am wrong.",13,t1_gvavfqu,2,1618996268.0

"dude, there's a difference between 70 taka and 2,700 taka(average) covid test in private hospitals, even if it isn't free, make it affordable to the mass, the government keeps their website for application open for just 5 minutes while the main supplier of this test kits to the private hospitals are the government ones.",1,t1_gvavfqu,2,1619006187.0

Funny to you but the fact is government let them run the monopoly and they (some government people) have share in their profit. Don't want to improve on public sector.,3,t1_gvazfcr,3,1619001052.0

"meaning, the government has the facility to provide it for cheap, but private corporations don't allow that, 70 taka tests are limited to persons who can apply within 5 minutes per day while 2700 taka tests are available throughout the year, give them 4000 taka you can get false negative certificates as well.",1,t1_gvbbcjv,4,1619006831.0
