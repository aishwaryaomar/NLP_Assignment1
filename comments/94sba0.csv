"Rational thought from a country where 883,000,000 (2/3rds) poop in the open wherever they are at that time. They lock rape victims in prison for protection from honor killings by family for being raped. We all have country issues, don't get me wrong. Tribal male dominated law runs that place. Mobs are easy to form when you earn $2 a day tops - if you live in a city.

"re: the poop

They've seen pooping since the day of their birth. So many of this region's problems seem to be the result of longstanding traditions. Can we expect this to change soon? If your home has no plumbing, what else can one do other than walk to a private location and dig a hole?

> They lock rape victims in prison for protection from honor killings by family for being raped.

It certainly seems they're handling this problem backwards. On the other hand, maybe protecting that victim is the only way to prevent a village of enraged locals coming after the police building with the crude weapons of the area.

Everybody must have heard of [the school burnings just a few days ago coming from Pakistan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-blast-schools/twelve-schools-bombed-burned-in-northern-pakistan-idUSKBN1KO1TV), which is in the same geographic area.  It may drive a person to believe that the whole region is simply screwed.

However..... to narrow down to the question of the existence of rational thought in that region... Doesn't it seem rather *irrational* to suggest that it is non-existent? Might it not seem more reasonable to consider rational thought as the commodity of the educationally rich... and that educational disparity is the relevant issue?

In other words, how to increase and protect education in that area? Seems this is the only way those people will free themselves of the culture and traditions that are clearly holding them back.",5,t1_e3o6nei,1,1533515823.0

"[This person](https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-legally-own-a-gun-in-Bangladesh) appears to be knowledgeable about this issue, and [this article](https://www.romper.com/p/what-are-bangladeshs-gun-laws-they-didnt-come-into-play-during-dhaka-attack-13621) makes it clear that regardless Bangladesh's gun laws, people there have knives, which means that while these pictures and videos are disturbing, it could be a lot worse.

"You can get a gun as long you have friends in ruling party. There are people that have multiple convictions that carry arms legally because they have influence in government.

"You are one of the smartest people on reddit in these areas that I have ever met. I agree with you 100%. Over the last decade, I was hoping that the cellular phone could be used for a large part of this with rural schooling. Ideas using PCs for children was just not going to work for everyone. However, everyone knows of one person with a phone. Sometimes a village has several phones and one is working. If the government (and corporate cell networks) rewarded school hours online with talk or text time, this would work better than not in my opinion. It would also help everyone running around in an emergency trying to find the one person with a working phone. ",4,t1_e3obg8j,2,1533517309.0

It sounds bizarre until you know that patients are tracked this way by doctors far away. You teach the patient (teacher) what data you need and when to send it in. I also know about the people that bring around books and read them as they can to really rural places. Sadly, we will all have other issues with weather sooner than later.
