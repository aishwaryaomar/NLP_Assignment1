"Let me tell you something. There's no good guy or bad guy. We're all morally grey and history is written by the Victor's so it cannot be trusted. We only know what the government had told us. Maybe he did everything for power or something else and not for his people out of his own kindness. Take my advice, don't believe everything they tell you in history because the reality is always hidden from the general public so that they can stay on top. I hope you understand now.

"Yeah! Then we should believe in PAKISTAN. Not our own people or countrymen who fought for our freedom. Now we should question the history that created the idea of Bangladesh...our own country!  Because, we were victorious & hIsTorY iS wRitteN bY thE vIctoR's. 
""Reality is always hidden from general public so that they can stay on top"" ... ummm right! actually the Pakistani government was so kind to us and they were so good. There was no such thing called liberation war or no one joined the force from ""general public"". We were the real bad guys actually.  These are the reality. Always hidden from ""general public""  :')

">U don't believe in our freedom struggle

I didn't say I don't believe in the struggles of our people. I just said that Mujib may not be the person we were taught him to be. Our country always whitewashes radical peoples in history. Makes them sound like they were really nice people who never did a single wrong in their entire life. Also just because some Pakistani cunts from 50 years ago commited mass genocide on innocent people doesn't mean we should hate the current generation of Pakistani's. 



>u don’t believe in the idea of our country

What I dea? That everyone is free? Free my ass. We don't even have freedom of speech. Anyone who talks against the govt. Gets killed. Votes are rigged so that no one can challenge their place. Is this the Idea of our country eh boy?

>have no right to insult our freedom struggle.bastard

Again I didn't insult our struggle in the war. I just said events in history may not have happened in the same way that we're taught it did. There's always truths hidden.

>u are a disgrace, leave this space and leave this country

Yes i am a disgrace. I know it and I completely own it.
I don't brush it off as nothing. And yes I will be leaving this god forsaken country which would just a miracle to recover when I'm old enough to travel to another country.

Remember ignoring your country's problems and thinking they're the greatest in the world doesn't make you a patriot. It just makes you an idiot whos ignorant to a bliss.

Now go on and cry to your mistress Hasina and tell her I've said these things so that she can kill me as well for uhh... How do I phrase this ""CoNSpiRiNg aGaiNSt tHe GoVErNmEnT"" or something a little more stupid",1,t1_grmzuu5,5,1616308312.0

"Both my grandfathers were freedom fighters. One was a staunch supporter of AL while other was a staunch supporter of BNP. Never heard any one of them say anything bad about Bongobondhu and I'm pretty sure their passing of knowledge to me isn't govt sponsored. This country is Bangladesh not China or North Korea where propaganda can be propagated and never will it prevail. And your claim that he wasn't what the current govt props him up to be then prove it with unbiased, irrefutable source instead of throwing shade on a martyr. Btw godforsaken country you said, tell me which country isn't? You're just another person living in a safety bubble created by your family who thinks he has some sort of moral highground. You're not a disgrace neither disgusting, you're just delusional who needs another reality check before he leaves for a ""better"", ""not godforsaken"" country.",1,t1_grodp4p,6,1616364401.0

The guys who killed him also had war accolades, pretty sure more than your gam gam.

Good now use muktijodha quota to get more assigned to you.",0,t1_grqvmmy,7,1616365186.0
"Im pretty sure none of my grandfather went to the war to get accolades. The way you formulated your reply shows you have no respect for the freedom fighters. But hiding behind the curtain of internet will surely give you that false sense of arrogance. So having war accolades justify their killing of a sitting president and his whole family. Why is that not despicable? Btw never used pathetic quota still got into du, jnu, ju, medical nor did any of my family member. And mainly because you're just bitter and I'm trying to rub you the wrong way I'm trying for bcs again without quota and most probably will get in the first chance.",3,t1_grqx6hv,8,1616432412.0
"the people who killed mujib had war accolades. Therefore their stance is viewed in greater light than your gam gams.

&#x200B;

I never said that the killings were wrong. What I said is that people who killed mujib were mutkijodhas as well. In fact the top of the class ones.

&#x200B;

Yeah I am hiding like awamis were post 1975. Everyone is a tiger in their back yard.

&#x200B;

Many muktijodas were looters and did all kind of shit. Hell some are even doing it now.
