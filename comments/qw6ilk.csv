That's the beauty of Bengali language. 'মাল' is plug and play. Apply কামানো/পটানো/টানা/ফেলা/একটা/খাওয়া/কেনা after it to express what you mean. one 'মাল' to rule them all.,11,t3_qw6ilk,0,1637209942.0

"**A pew () is a long bench seat or enclosed box, used for seating members of a congregation or choir in a church, synagogue or sometimes a courtroom.


== Overview ==

The first backless stone benches began to appear in English churches in the thirteenth century, originally placed against the walls of the nave.**
