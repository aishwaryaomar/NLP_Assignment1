"A lot of misunderstanding with this tweet. 

The author isn't mocking Bangladesh. He is using Bangladesh as an example of a non-East Asian country adopting some of the development patterns of East Asian economies in the past, by focusing on manufacturing. A lot of people implicitly imply that the east-Asian development model cannot be successfully applied to non east Asian states, especially South Asia and Africa, due to cultural reasons. They may be partially right. But Bangladesh at least followed some (if not all) of the development traits of East Asian countries. The biggest difference being the lack of solid human capital investments, particularly in education. Just compare the education level of Vietnam with BD. Vietnam scores are higher than many developed countries in international mathematics and science rankings. Bangladeshi pupils can just about read and write, and that's it. Not really comparable 

If you read his op-ed, he shows how Bangladesh's development curve has been almost perfectly smooth, whereas for her neighbors, it was (still is) much more turbulent. In other words, Bangladesh is the cumulative result of decades of sustained growth, at least from the 1990s. And the manufacturing sector had a role in that. 

It's worth noting that South Korea was once known as a T-shirt making country, with labour costs even lower than Pakistan/India in the 1960s! The East Asian economic model is nothing radical, it's quite simple in principle. You start off from basic, build competency, open up your markets to the rest of the world, accumulate wealth, and go up the value chain. Easy in principle, but difficult in execution though. You need a strong, preferably technocratic government, functional institutions, and the rule of law to make it work fully. Which Bangladesh does not have. 

Bangladesh is moving up the value chain fast, but it's early days. We never had the capital or the infrastructure (especially our previously anemic energy grid) to upscale and grow factories and production. But now, things are changing. The RMG industry isn't even close to its full potential. Expect it to grow further, but also expect other industries to grow in parallel. 

For obvious reasons, India will always have a far larger industrial firepower than us, given their size. It's like comparing Russia with say, Poland or Estonia. The latter two can never compete with Russian when it comes to heavy industries like automotive, aerospace, space, infrastructure, even bio-tech. But Poland, and Estonia in particular, found their own niche which they were really good at. As a result, Estonia is far more prosperous than Russia these days. Though sanctions/oil prices had something to do with Russia's stagnation, I hope the point stands regardless. India had TATA steel as far back as the British Raj. Bangladesh was pretty much all an agricultural land that saw very little development under the Brits and Pakistan. Non-the-less, Bangladesh is industrializing big time now. We won't be able to match India in quantity/diversity even, but we can sure give them a run for their money in quality, on the few things we produced. Garments were one area, but now we're focusing on electronics, shipbuilding, steel processing. 

On the other hand, India is becoming much more closed off. It relies on heavy protectionism because her industries, as big, mighty, and diverse as they are, aren't generally competitive enough in the global market. They rely primarily on domestic consumption. Modi can have a go at that, let's see where it gets him. When all the successful economies that had emerged from the developing world, got thereby making things people around the world want to buy. 

Basically, India is not a good development model for us to follow. Yet many of us have this obsession with our dysfunctional neighbors when we can learn much more from others.",3,t3_o7r5jz,0,1624888964.0

West Bengal had a massive headstart compared to everyone. They had the highest per capita income in India in the 1960s.It went all downhill after that.Today it's [23rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_and_union_territories_by_GDP_per_capita) and getting even further left behind  (much lower growth than Indian average during the 2010s).Nothing wrong with left wing but communist idiots went full blown anti business ,anti property and even anti common sense once they took power.Communists banned [English](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/05/world/west-bengal-halting-teaching-of-english-for-primary-students.html) for example in government primary schools.They called it a imperialist language.They also opposed computers and banned them for a long time.Businessmen were openly beaten up.

&#x200B;

>They didn't have to deal with a brutal independence war and one military dictatorship after another like Bangladesh did.

This is why a lot of Indians admire and compliment Bangladesh for its growth.Not  because we compare it to India (which is too diverse) but west bengal. Bangladesh had no choice other than develop. Most people couldn't just leave for foreign countries unless illegally. In west bengal,those who could,simply left the state for more prosperous states. Kolkata was the only metro city in India in the 2000s that saw its [population decline](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/kolkata-s-population-drop-leaves-experts-puzzled-111051600003_1.html). That's insane especially in a country where the population is still increasing.

&#x200B;

>Bangladesh and West Bengal more or less have the same living standards, as far as I know.

Certainly not true. Perhaps the middle class but the poor are probably much better in Bangladesh. Important to know that middle class in west bengal is  smaller and mostly employed in government sector. They actually benefit from the status quo because Kolkata is pretty cheap to live in and govt salaries are pretty good.There are barely any large private industries there.Most young Indian Bengalis you encounter on social media actually live outside bengal or plan to leave because they see no future.",3,t1_h338j03,4,1624718842.0
"It's a big complex question facing every Indian, each state  - I can give you a geoeconomic, socio-political and policy based answer. Reality is probably a mix of all. For e.g. Urbanization sets of virtuous cycles that erode things like caste consciousness.

That said, Delhi/NCR is quite rich with a PPP per capita \~ 20,000 and 25 million people so clearly it can be done.

First the big obvious issues, then more speculative ones -

**1) Geography** 

Ports. Landlocked regions suck for export oriented manufacturing. Automobile manufacturing came up in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat much later than Delhi (Maruti Suzuki) - but because they were easier to export from they grew much larger faster than the industries in the landlocked state which only have competitive advantage when building for the local market.

North India used to use the Ganga as a ""port"" or a sea substitute of sorts, but (a) it's not well developed as a shipping route, and (b) the population now is too large to rely on a river for large scale industrial trade.

The only real port in the North - Calcutta, dropped the ball badly by electing communists and Mumbai, Chennai, Kozhikode etc did not.

**2) Economic Policy**

So we have established reasons north has advantages as an effective industrial center for its substantial domestic market, it has a lot of mineral resources, but disadvantages when it comes to export oriented manufacturing. The government came up with a classic genius Indian govt policy called **freight equalization** \- which basically said that you would pay a constant subsidized price for transporting raw material like coal, steel, etc anywhere in the country, (but this did not apply to finished goods). As as result of this policy, most of the landlocked states saw deindustrialization as local industries stopped doing value addition - e.g. instead of doing vertical integration of iron ore -> steel -> machinery leveraging proximity to mine and market, the local economies focused on resource extraction and agriculture to maximize subsidy utilization, while assembly and manufacturing came up near the port cities mainly in the south.

Old industrial centers like Kanpur died out during this time. So north had disadvantages in manufacturing - this policy exacerbated the difference and deindustrialized the north and made it a farming/resource extraction hub, while giving fat subsidies to port exporters. It took ages for people to realize that this was a stupid move.

**3) Politics**

Calcutta was a big port in the north - and communist rule destroyed it. When the communists realized economics and decided to set up a tata nano manufacturing plant, TMC came and became more communist than the communists and rioted there, destroyed the plant and got elected. Now the TMC is realizing that economics works and making reform - I fully expect the people of West Bengal to self sabotage even further by electing someone else.

UP is our own Hindu Pakistan. Less said the better.

Bihar is highly agrarian and thus super casteist. It also had a lost decade+ of sorts under Lalu Yadav who basically 'empowered the lower castes' - i.e. told the police to look away as his caste went open season on the upper castes and the dalits. It was basically anarchy until the central government imposed presidents rule and a reformist PM

**4) History**

North India's traditional export routes go through Pakistan, which are now gone. South India has always had a tradition of sea based trade. The North is also more invested in the India-Pakistan drama, angry about perceived excesses under Muslim rule, and dealing with Pakistan turns you into a mean angry human on the best of days, which might play a role (this is just a theory).

e.g. sort of like how the people of don't care about themselves as long as they hurt India - UP, Bihar, MP etc sort of don't have strong sub-nationalism and identify as 'pan-Indian' and are happy as long as India as a whole is doing well (or at least better than Pakistan) instead of focusing inwards and fixing their own specific issues. This is conjecture - but basically since all of India's hostile borders are in the north - the north is more pre-occupied in this siege mindset of feeling responsible for preserving the territorial integrity of India, which can be exploited for hindu-muslim political bullshit.

**5) Language?**

This is an interesting thing that I've been thinking of lately. All of north India is not poor - Delhi is rich, Punjab, Haryana, Western UP (Noida), Uttarakhand and even J&K are quite reasonably well off. The main poverty hot spot is the overpopulated hub of Eastern UP/Bihar, which incidentally is where I trace my lineage from.

Now one thing about the Bihar region is that it's local languages are Bhojpuri, Maithili, Angika, etc - which shares a common linguistic ancestor with Bengali but are classified as dialects of Hindi rather than separate languages (although there's a ton of evidence that this is idiotic).

As an ethnic maithil/bhojpuri I have lost my mother tongue in that sense and only know Hindi, this is ok for Urban India where Hindi and English will get you through - but in rural Bihar/Bhojpur - the kids of this region have been taught for decades in Hindi, a language nobody at home speaks - which has led to the state having the worst literacy outcomes in the country.

As most B'deshis will probably understand the importance of having education in your mother tongue as a key ingredient for improving mass education - this ingredient was missing in the east UP/Bihar region.

The tribal regions of Jharkhand, Chattisgarh have similar issues because they speak austroasiatic languages - not even indo-aryan/dravidian - and it will be unlikely that they get educated in their native languages.",4,t1_h3454cx,4,1624740469.0

Last year before the pandemic nominal GSDP grew 15.36% in Bihar (2nd highest in the country) and 15.04% in WB (3rd highest). UP? 6.5% - the lowest of all states for which data is available - and that's despite UP getting free runoff growth from Delhi NCR in Noida (where for e.g. Samsung has built the world's largest smartphone factory) for which the state honestly deserves zero credit. 

Please check your information sources, you might be stuck in a certain political party's disinformation narrative.

Bihar's been growing rapidly ever since Lalu lost power, but 15 years of negative growth is no joke to recover from. TMC is more middle-class and growth oriented today than the days when it carried out the Singur violence. And UP is a massive flop show being showcased as a success by a certain political group.",2,t1_h3aas0l,5,1624875678.0
"As usual the North Indian forgets a key point. Remember how your Indira Gandhi did a massive brain extermination of the Bengali youth in the 70s?

"They could have passed the farm bills without a problem if people trusted them more, but they don’t seem to understand that trust is a privilege not a right. A lot of people I speak to can recount exact moments in the last 4-5 years when the Modi govt. lost their trust (common examples: de-mon, CAA), without necessarily achieving great results. I think they used their political capital on useless publicity stunts instead of hard reform. DM me if you want to discuss it more, don’t want to crowd up this thread!

But agree about Gadkari! He’s done a great job building highways.",4,t1_h31qpm5,5,1624663856.0

"USA also has a growth rate of around 2-3%, is india bette than the USA now?

Ans the govt has brought in many investor and industry favourable policies. Maybe you are just in denial

Poor growth rate is just a continuation of previous administration. It takes time fix itself, but go ahead, harp on. Don’t forget that WB is a still a shitty place after a decade of TMC and decade(s) of communists",1,t1_h3b12fc,6,1624880318.0
That wasn't exclusive to Bengal. The decline started long before. There was never any shortage of Bengali talent. They just got jobs outside Bengal.  There were multiple reasons for Bengal decline - with commies getting control the biggest. Industrial decline started as soon as commies gained control for the first time. Bengal also couldn't get IT in time because of commie opposition to computers. in the 1970s and 80s. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was the only visionary commie leader and he tried his best to get Bengal back into track. Most of the big IT names in Kolkata came during time. Bengali growth was pretty good in 2000s. Lesser said about Mamata banerjee the better.,1,t1_hn77gj1,6,1638638452.0
"I am blaming the state of UP right now, i.e. the current GDP growth rate, on BJP. Last year before the pandemic it had the lowest GDP growth of all major states.

That said no party in UP has a good track record - SP, BSP, Congress and now BJP all have played communal and caste politics to win, and delivered little to no growth. Maybe the relationship is inverted - that they are forced to play identity politics to win because nobody has figured out how to make UP grow.

Many people supported BJP when they won in UP even if not elsewhere in India, the propaganda in the educated BJP supporter circles was that Manoj Sinha (current LG of Kashmir, who is an IIT grad) would be the technocratic chief minister who would develop UP and Yogi Adityanath was portrayed as a 'fringe' figure after sharing the dais with a man who wanted for Hindus to dig out the corpses of muslim women and rape them.

Fast forward a few years, people have forgotten all of this. Manoj Sinha is in an unenviable position of being responsible for solving extremism in Kashmir. Adityanath was mainstreamed and made CM, is being whitewashed as some great administrator despite delivering no GDP growth, and is now the most popular CM in India for whatever reason that you probably will know better than me given your obvious  leanings.",1,t1_h3ab35t,6,1624876459.0

Another thing, I am a reformist. PV Narasimha Rao was a great gift given to india and the Congress treated him like trash.
