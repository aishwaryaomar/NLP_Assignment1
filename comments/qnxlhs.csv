"He's hanging onto that phone because of sentimental values, not because its great piece of tech.  
Walton makes shitty stuff wrapped in ""Deshi Product"" tag.  


Used their Pendrive, SSD, mouse and electric ketley and they all did a spectacular job of disappointing each time",48,t3_qnxlhs,0,1636226706.0

"I can guarantee you if anyone's laughing at Walton products it's because the products don't perform as advertised and marketed. Some walton products are good, some are ok, some are...not. And that's perfectly fine.

Anyway, from what it looks like, the professor is using the phone to illustrate Bangladesh's economic and technological growth, not as a phone. 

If you're buying Walton out of national pride, sure, ok, fine. You're not buying something because it does the job it's supposed to, but out of some sense of nostalgia.

Honestly though I'm very curious as to who is laughing at people for using walton phones - I'm sure they're not flagships, but I've never heard of them being that bad. Idk.",5,t3_qnxlhs,0,1636274528.0
"Do you guys really believe that people make fun of other people just for the choice of their tech commodities? Gimme a break.

Usually, no one gives a shit about what phone you use. Phones were hot back in circa 2011-2017 and now all the phones look the same to me. The same rectangular slab of overpriced glasses‚Äîpackaged differently each year and insecure ass people drool over them. Used 6 flagships in six years, starting from 2012-2018, and wasted a bunch of money that I could've used to do something better. Now my Xiaomi mi 9 whacks asses of all the phones I've ever owned. $200 bucks of reliability.

If you need to signal your wealth, there are better ways of doing so other than buying the next iPhone and taking mirror selfies. I know a bunch of rich AF people who could care less about phones and I also happen to know a few losers with iPhones bought on loans. If you happen to own a Walton, be proud of it; wait it's just a phone, what's there to be proud of!",5,t3_qnxlhs,0,1636300565.0
Never had a walton but is it that bad? Do ya'll actually bully people over it?,10,t3_qnxlhs,0,1636212266.0
Walton phones aren't bad for cheap price. I think they are better than samsungs of similar price. Which slows down after a while.,6,t3_qnxlhs,0,1636220434.0
"I once bought a Walton phone and used it for 3-4 years, was honestly a great phone! Hell, I dropped the phone so many times, flew from my hand, sat on it, and the phone powered through it all. I don't remember what model it was but it cost around 9k or something. Definitely would recommend their phones tbh.",6,t3_qnxlhs,0,1636227669.0

"Tbh that phone was most likely rebranded from a Chinese phone, i.e. they just sealed the logo and did some software tweaks to change its name software wise.

Bought one as my first smartphone as I could not afford anything else. After that I always like their products on low budget smartphone but with time so many companies in the market for low budget smartphone. Imagine what you can get within 12k comparing that same 12k phone 6years ago.,2,t3_qnxlhs,0,1638034187.0

"i havent used much walton products in my life. just an android. a Primo GM mini bought back in 2015 by my sister. her frnds daughters somehow ended up damaging the sim slots. so it was virtually impossible for my sister to use anymore. when i was done with my jsc at the end of 2017, she bought a new one and gave me the walton one as i could still use it with wifi. its not a great phone. but my priorities were too simple for me to just discard it and buy a new one. Browsing, Discord, Facebook, Mangas, Youtube and thats it. i dropped it more than a few hundred times and the shits still intact. the battery died this years january. and i was saving money for a pc. so just bought another battery instead of a new phone.  


its os is kitkat 4.4.2 and many apps are already unsupported for it. but my priorities align well with it and im not bothered much about calls either since got a cheap ""button"" phone (dunno what should i call it) for that. i dunno how this phone still is alive. it hangs and lags a lot. understandable since its been so many yrs. but ive learned contentment from an early age so it doesnt bother me. most of my work is done on pc anyways.",1,t3_qnxlhs,0,1636264545.0

I used to be a Walton smartphone fan actually when they first came out. I would suggest people to buy them and they were quite good for their price. Until Xiaomi came out with the Redmi Note 3. After that Xiaomi has been dominating the market here.,1,t3_qnxlhs,0,1636241268.0

" Well that's where you are wrong.
My grandma used a cheap (12k - 15k) Walton phone and it was the worst phone I've ever touched.
It ended up lasting for about 2 months.
On the other hand my dad used the Samsung Galaxy J7 for over 6 years.
Although it's not a very fair comparison for the price difference.
But my cousin is using a 15k Xiaomi for the last 3 years it's still as good as new.

"Financial literacy...huh. There's a group on FB called BCUB (Bank Card Users Bangladesh) and every loser under the sun wants to get their hands on a credit card in that group. People be like‚Äî""I make 25k a month (It's respectable and I'm not jeering at it) and I've saved up 200k. Can I get a titanium-iridium-<put\_any\_imaginary\_metal\_name> card with an FDR?"" And then the lurking bank agents launch their mob attacks and the rest is history.

They cry for these cards not because they need them but because everyone in their circle apparently has these. Bank agents are robbing these people blind in broad daylight and getting lauded by other illiterates in the same group. In a country where 99.99% of payments are cash only and the rest of the 0.01% requires additional fees just for using the privilege of digital payment, owning a credit card with a huge limit is kinda sad.
