">We should show them who’s the dog

So you are the dogs till then ?

Underdog has nothing to do with dogs bro lol. Despite beating Aussies, you will still be underdogs when you play them in WC cause you will come from qualifier round.  No hate.",3,t1_h7yssgi,1,1628328364.0

U do realize that our team only has 3 experienced players? All this time we were playing with 6 newbies LMAO and also y lurk on Bangladeshi subreddit,4,t1_h81edud,2,1628334902.0
"Have you ever heard of word plays maybe ? You don’t have to teach me what _underdog_ means; I’m most likely 5X more educated than you are. If I need a revision of the term, I pay my Internet bills, so Google is there for me. Thanks for stalking my page; I’m proud of my Indo-Bangla background; I have family on both sides of the border. I call out both when I see they’re throwing sh#t at each other. My Indian side is happy b/c India already won two world cups; my Bangladeshi roots are not happy, since we still haven’t won any of the cups despite talent. BD economy has gotten better; better talent processing now. BD is on the rise, and that’s the point. Denying that makes this quite hateful and you v. us.",2,t1_h81edud,2,1628341504.0

"First of all, I am not demeaning Bangladesh win. All I am saying is that being underdog doesn't mean you are a dog. It's not offensive to be underdog. And, one win doesn't make your stars change direction.

>U do realize that our team only has 3 experienced players?

Go and have a poll then, will full strength Bangladesh not be an underdog infront of full strength Australia in WC, out of their home.

>All this time we were playing with 6 newbies LMAO and also y lurk on Bangladeshi subreddit

The guy I replied is a poster in Indian subreddit and he posts about Indian news, he also participates in other Indian subreddits, go and check his profile. I can't even comment here ? It's my first time here. Pls check, before judging. Please don't turn this into you vs us.",0,t1_h81lw7p,3,1628336624.0
"Bro, I stalked you to find some shit against that guy's unprovoked angry comment (just like yours now).

Why are you making a villain out of me ?  It wasn't even a topic ! I don't care what your background is.

As you said my uneducated ass, who can't pay his bills. Don't know english... wordplay and all. My bad.

Your earlier comment doesn't sounded all goody-goody with my family, and my roots and all.",1,t1_h81vng0,3,1628342016.0
