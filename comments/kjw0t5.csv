Growing up in the western world where 99% of people have no idea what Bangladesh is and think its part of India - you bet we will cherish finally being recognised as a standalone country and how great of the country we are becoming.,40,t3_kjw0t5,0,1608912609.0

This was me after I saw a movie in a theater in GTA V and on the credits it said the VFX was done in a sweatshop in Bangladesh.. I was too excited to process the sweatshop part at first so the excitement died quick as you can imagine lol,13,t3_kjw0t5,0,1608916069.0

"Well, we're a small and relatively new country. We don't really have a lot of things that're famous around the world, so, it feels good to see that there are people who recognizes us. Even Indians get excited when they see their country mentioned somewhere and they're a much larger and culturally distinguised nation.",9,t3_kjw0t5,0,1608914554.0

And ppl need to wake up and do something to improve. Without self reflection and self realization qnd identifying the problems, we cant have change.

Definitely shit. Better shit than Bangladesh tho. Its not about feelings. Its about the truth. The facts are...both are shit infact anywhere humans are found are horrible. But one is better than the other. I dont refrain from criticism and you shouldnt either.,1,t1_gh01zo1,9,1608917789.0
