Is there not a chance that this could also protect people? There was a call to inform Facebook that a list of names had been leaked on facebook. The list contained the names and addresses of people that had helped protestors escape. If facebook is down in that area it gives time to try and remove content that could harm people? Or even just buys these people some time. A possibility?,35,t3_94rbfg,0,1533482792.0
"Facebook is not down in whole Dhaka, it is still very much accessible using broadband internet lines. But there is a very good chance that it might be deactivated nationwide anytime soon.",20,t3_94rbfg,0,1533482804.0

What is the source of the Facebook outage map?,1,t3_94rbfg,0,1533569311.0
It would be super useful if somebody on the affected network could run OONI Probe (the Facebook Messenger and Web Connectivity tests) to collect evidence of the blocking: [https://ooni.torproject.org/install/](https://ooni.torproject.org/install/) (it's available on Android and iOS).,1,t3_94rbfg,0,1533569419.0
"I would think that since the government controls internet in bamgladesh, they can access it without any problem.",19,t1_e3neqj4,1,1533486275.0
"If it's because the ISP, changing dns server could help. 

For eg. 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220",5,t1_e3nessf,1,1533499611.0
"Not if facebook isn't servicing an area or country. Now obviously someone somewhere else in Bangladesh could access the info and communicate through a different medium. The government controls internet access (through their control of service providers) but it does not 'control the internet'. If facebook decided to pull the figurative plug - naebodys accessing facebook. The Government could throw any raging hissy fit they wanted - they wouldn't be able to access facebook.

Edit: My tone feels more combative and prickly than I intended.
My point was that fb provision (or lack thereof) in that area at that time might be outwith their control. ",11,t1_e3ni3sg,2,1533496153.0
