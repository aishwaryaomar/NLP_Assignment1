"You are a blind supporter of BAL mafia. BAL is committing grotesque atrocities against innocent people. Police and RAB are filled with BAL thugs. They kidnap people at the dead of night. Torture them then extort money. All level of BAL leadership gets a cut. Most of the BAL MPs are worth 100M+, Ministers even more. Sheikh family members have proxy friends holding billions of dollar on their behalf.  


BAL has been horrible prosperity and economy. I have the stats to prove it but admin to put it in comments.
