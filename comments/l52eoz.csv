"Biryani is a piece of heaven on earth. The name alone can stop a crying child, it gives hope in the hearts of people, it's gives us joy in life. Biryani isn't just a food, it's a festival of flavors, a war field of aroma, a beautiful feast for the eyes. That's why biryani is my 2nd favorite food. The 1st is the ultimate combo of dal-alur bhorta-bhat.",4,t3_l52eoz,0,1611636987.0
