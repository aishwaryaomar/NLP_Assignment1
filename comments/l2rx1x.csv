"Why do we look down on Lungis? It‚Äôs our own attire ffs, I see 7-8 year old kids wearing head to toe burqa and nobody bats an eye, but we think lungi is ‚Äúkhet‚Äù.",64,t3_l2rx1x,0,1611346778.0

Proud of these folks. They are holding on to our culture. KFC is just an outlet why do we need to dress up as westerners to visit them :),6,t3_l2rx1x,0,1611390588.0
"Story time: 

This happened back in 2008.

A bunch of us were hanging out in a lemonade shop in puran dhaka, they had some speciality lemonade and we were there to check them out. A couple of these kind of old dirty lungi and fotua wearing uncles sat opposite us.One of our friend was from Bangshal,  she said in  a hushed whisper, don't underestimate these people, you'll never know how much dough one is carrying in this part of the town. 

Right after she finished saying this, our waiter delivered the lemonades to both parties. And one uncle get couple wads of cash out of his torn pocket, and gave the other guy. And he was so sorry, like bhai I only could arrange this 2 lac now, I'll give you the rest in the evening. 

And we were sitting here with eyes like saucers. 

Those puran dhaka people have real do-not-have-fuck-to-give swag and we new dhaka people would never be able to reach. There is something in the air or something. Lol.",7,t3_l2rx1x,0,1611387096.0

Idk why people is making such a fuss about this? Is there any dress code for going to a foodcourt or restaurant? In other countries people dresses as comfy as they can when going to eat. But we dress get ready like its a huge deal to go for a snack to someplace.,4,t3_l2rx1x,0,1611385621.0

"First of all it is a loaded question. Not all people who wear lungi is considered khat.Only a certain type of people who wear lungis are considered khat.

&#x200B;

**This picture answers your question.**

Because it is associated with people like this.

Who the hell sits with your bare feet on the chair in a place where people are there to eat food. We do not want to see your nasty feet. You think he is not aware of that?

&#x200B;

**Most people who wears lungi would not do it, and those people are not considered khat.**

These type of people are not even khat it is uncultured, in Bengali culture we are taught to sit with your feet down and this guy is aware of it but still does it.",29,t1_gk8fept,1,1611358697.0
"Lungi is very comfortable to wear. Anyone who has worn it for sometimes knows it not to call it ""Khet"".

But..... Few weeks ago i saw some students wearing Lungi at a food place. They were students of a friend of mine and he told me that, they hadn't actually wear them at home. So, they didn‚Äôt know what to wear and how to wear. Some of them wore their dad's Lungi, that looked awkward. And some of them wore ""‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶∏‡¶≤‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∞ ‡¶≤‡ßÅ‡¶Ç‡¶ó‡¶ø"" which they grabbed from local market at a cheap price. But they looked ""Khet"" overall. But these uncles (apaart from their manner) as they wear them regularly(i guess) they do not look awkward.",3,t1_gk8fept,1,1611383586.0

"It's not about how they dress. It's about their manners..look how the dude in the lungi is sitted legs spread, can see the feet almost close to the table where we eat..but yes people in bd will 100% judge when someone goes to a five star res with lungi the same in foreign country's if you go with crocs,tank top and shorts",4,t1_gkb9cu0,1,1611422295.0
