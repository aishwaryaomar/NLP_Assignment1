"1) Read my comment again. I said sins of the *Bengali* ancestors (i.e. his allegations of Bangladesh “supporting India”), not the war crimes committed by Pakistani soldiers in the 1970s

2) Not *every* Pakistani has an ancestor who committed these war crimes. That doesn’t mean every Pakistani is innocent, only that you should limit your criticism to the actual perpetrators and their families, not every *single* citizen who ever walked beneath the Pakistani flag. Otherwise it becomes one of those unproductive “You Jews killed our Jesus!” blaming games that only alienate further

3) My point was also that it doesn’t even *matter* whether war crimes were committed or not in this specific context, since Bengali students today are completely removed from the wartime sins of the ‘70s, and ergo should be dealt with as an entirely separate humanitarian crisis

4) Some soul-searching also must be done on the part of Bangladesh moving forward. Hasina did not get elected all by herself, which means at least a minority of your own countrymen *are* completely fine with having monsters like her in power, and are thus a moral tumor",2,t1_e3qaqay,3,1533607127.0
