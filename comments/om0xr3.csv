"I don't get the stigma towards private universities (and also private jobs) in BD society.

As if just one admission test at a public university is enough to determine a person's true intelligence.",51,t3_om0xr3,0,1626528782.0
I have similar experience. Corporations in BD said I am not good enough. So here I am in a first world country making 10 times more. They never wonder about where I got my degree or which family I am coming from. All they focus on is if I have the skill set.,23,t3_om0xr3,0,1626542420.0

"This is the real picture in Bangladesh. This guy would strike a cord with many who left BD and who are trying/planning to leave. I observed that often students from private universities, teachers at private universities and people doing private jobs in general are looked down upon in BD society however qualified they are. It seemed to me that most Bangladeshis are still stuck in the 1940s/1950s/1960s' mentality as  far as their outlook on employment is concerned.  Is it due to Bangladesh having been subjected to colonial rule for decades? Or is it simply snobbery? I saw many Bangladeshis saluting people however corrupt and bad they may be only because they are rich and powerful. Could such a society save itself from the brain drain d as its talented, smart, and industrious are fleeing the country in droves every year? Would such a society ever get rid of corruption? 

Believe me, it is true. I graduated from one of the biggest and oldest public universities  and taught for several years at a good private university in BD before leaving it.",43,t3_om0xr3,0,1626528143.0

"Well it is not just private uni. You can study from a public one and most probably can not join at another uni as a faculty member. It can be a kind of nepotism/favouritism.

However a probable reason why we neglect students from private uni is the admission tests. Generally students who pass in the tests study in the public uni but others try their luck in national/private. So we naturally build the notion that public students are ""Genius"" and others are ""Weak"". Again we tend to be biased considering the corruptions here. Therefore, private=bad.

Edit: Brain drain is a national problem.The whole system is actually responsible here.",15,t3_om0xr3,0,1626532508.0

"Just finished reading some of the comments in this post.  


Private vs Public University: I think both has it's own type of student body. I would not go and compare it as apple to apple. Personally I always felt since I did not get to go to Buet or some other good school I would not be as good. Then one day I started working in a job in a western company with another Buet graduate. That was enough for me to realize it did not matter at all.  


Brain Drain: Yes there will be brain drain and I hope BAL or any other BD government dose not make any stupid law to stop it. Only acceptable way to stop brain drain is change the corporate environment in BD and somehow create an environment where companies can flourish and innovate. Until that happens we need to accept that brain drain happens.  


There are good sides of bran drain. I know 4-5 companies in US and Netherlands where BD guys control the technology teams. They now directly interview ppl from BD and hire them. They fly them over as well.",6,t3_om0xr3,0,1626544232.0

And for the person in the post, leaving this country because one company degraded him for having degree from a private university is an absolute bonkers logic. Yeah there are more than a thousand reasons to leave this country (even I want to leave asap), but this is just his ego saying these things. 
There are companies in Bangladesh that value the skills inside people  no matter whatever their university background is.

The stigma is there because BD private corporations are being run by old outdated people. MNCs on the other hand can scout talents better. They don't care about the private public bullshit if you've got strong skills to back up for it.,9,t1_h5iinwx,1,1626563528.0
"I wonder if that guy has ever done a job interview. I interviewed more than 100s of candidates for our company and it was disappointing to see students from private universities cannot even answer simple programming questions. We still didnt lose faith until we started to interview people from NSU, IUB etc. And they were asking for 70-80k salary which doesn’t make sense because most of them didn’t have any job experience and the position was for freshers. So then we decided we have to completely filter out private University students because out of 89 interviews none of the private University guy was selected even for the second round of the interview. When we interviewed only 7 people from public University 5 from Polytechnic and the results were astonishing, We hired 1 polytechnic guy and 1 public University guy. So yeah the number speaks for themselves. You might ask why did we even bother to interview so many private university candidates, well turns out that they also lie in their resumes the most.

True, but nowhere near like BD, or the crap this guy endured. He’ll enjoy a great salary and benefits for his talents in the US. Would he have liked to stay in BD? Sure, but nonsense like this guy endured shows he would never use his education in Bd.

Patriotism is vastly overrated, screaming “joy bangla” like a madman or singing “amar shonar bangla” till you turn blue will never provide you with a good income, and life for yourself and family.

"Disclaimer: Should've said it beforehand, but I am still an HSC candidate as of writing this comment and therefore I have **no** right to lecture actual qualified people on these type of things. So everything I said in this thread should be taken with a grain of salt and I'd gladly appreciate it if someone stepped in to correct me in case I'm wrong.

Although the original point of my comment which is that studying in a private university doesn't automatically make you less talented (as a lot of Bangladeshis believe) still stands, I do agree that students from public universities tend to be a lot more talented than their private counterparts. But I think that's mostly because public universities (due to being cheaper and more prestigious) attract students from various different backgrounds who compete in fiercely competitive admission tests (So yes, I take back what I said about admission tests not mattering much, they do), where only a fraction of applicants succeed. Which means that getting admitted to a public university is a lot harder than getting admitted to a private university (where simply having parents with deep pockets is enough for the most part).",4,t1_h5ltcjs,2,1626601911.0
"I had the impression it's the other way around? Even going by perception, most Bengali's I spoke to tended to massively favor private domains. Because the public ones are thought of as highly corrupt, ineffective, and inefficient, which they are. 

I guess Dhaka University and BUET will probably open more doors to graduates than NSU et al. But the private ones are improving at a much higher rate, with better facilities. The traditional ones have literally gone back over the decades. Relying on historical perception probably won't cut it for very long.",1,t1_h5il6uq,2,1626572703.0

How does that differ from here? If he stayed he’d be a wage slave here, not some great innovator.
