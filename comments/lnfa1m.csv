"Bengalis are also found in India. Indian is a nationality and one can infer from much of the work of Rabindranath Tagore that he was as much an Indian as anybody else. Of course, his role in the history of Bangladesh is indispensable, but I don't think that his role in the formation of the modern Indian thought can be diminished, not to mention that it is India which has done the most to promote and preserve his legacy. Also, Pakistan did nor exist prior to 1947, and the Indus flows through India first before reaching Pakistan. Hopefully, we can all work together towards a better future for all! üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáßüá©üáßüá©",0,t1_go2elnn,2,1615024945.0

"Tagore happens to be the writer of the national anthem of both Bangladesh and India. ""Amar Sonar Bangla"" was written in the spirit of a unified Bengal region before the partition in 1905 split the region up across arbitrary religious lines. 

For the majority of his life though, Bengal would have included both West Bengal in India and Bangladesh.",11,t1_go0bvgy,5,1613755850.0

"Thank you for that answer. I was partially trolling but admittedly am oblivious to the history too.

Grew up in the UK, my parents never really spoke about our history. Although we have visited Bangladesh number of times, the country itself was never spoken about. Just the usual BNP Awami league chat among dad's friends whilst watching the news. 

I've read up sparingly over the years. But barely. Is there a book you would recommend?",0,t1_go0zl8r,6,1613756251.0

"I understand. I grew up in the US and had to teach myself how to read/write Bangla (my handwriting is really bad). Very proud to be Bangladeshi American though. :)

Tagore was the first non-European to be awarded a Nobel prize. If you like poetry, you can try reading the anthology that Tagore won the award for, Gitanjali.

I've read quite a few books about Bangladesh, so I think it depends on what you're looking for. A history book or to learn more about Bengali literature?",3,t1_go10hr8,7,1613757374.0
"When did your parents migrate to the States?

Haha well I couldn't tell bad handwriting from good. It's awesome that you self taught. Must be nice, especially being into poetry, to have so much more accessible to you.

Nice, will check out Gitanjali! And why not a couple of books on each?",1,t1_go132hv,8,1613761884.0
