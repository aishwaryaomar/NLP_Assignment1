My nana would take us to Titas corner store on mirpur road near Dhanmondi whenever he picked me and my sister up from school. We were allowed to choose anything we wanted. I used to love it whenever it was his turn to pick us up bc that meant I could get all the candy I wasn't allowed to eat lol. So many memories :),4,t3_lrxju5,0,1614264378.0

I have the same type of nostalgia with soft jilapis (‡¶ú‡¶ø‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶™‡ßÄ). My dada passed away some years before I was born but I got to have my nanabhai until I was around 14. Almost every Friday morning we'd visit my grandparents and stay the whole day. After the Jumma prayer he'd always come home with some jilapis. Never asked or even thought whether he bought those or something he received from the mosque after the prayer. But good old memories. I remember waiting for him to get home so I could chomp chomp. üò¨üòÇ,3,t3_lrxju5,0,1614245286.0
