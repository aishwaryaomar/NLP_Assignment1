This literally made me laugh. They seem to be taking Trump's fake news PR strategy and really running with it...the truth is not so easy to hide when information can be democratized online ..,10,t3_94nzgw,0,1533491710.0

"As an international visitor to this sub, that's so fucked up. I will remember this forever. I've got a strong stomach for the internet but this has cut me to the core. 

Students protesting peacefully and productively for the basic public services they've been promised. Raped, eye-gouged, murdered. And then to pull this shit. That is as clear as corruption gets.

My heart goes out to everyone on the ground over there. I hope you all see a better Bangladesh soon.",11,t1_e3mf32q,1,1533507139.0

"I live in Bangladesh and my family has participated in the protests and suffered the consequences.. I was referring to this particular msg sent by the government and their supporters chalking all the horrific incidents to ""gujob"" or fake news ..which was yes the same strategy used by politicians the world over but definitely made more infamous by Donald trump in recent years ..",19,t1_e3nrjsm,2,1533496246.0

"Very American of you to wish violence on another person just because they brought up Trump. 

They mentioned him because the notion of fake news has been popularized with the MAGA movement and the Bangladesh government took that as an opportunity to copy the same tactic. 

But they forgot what Trump said about fake news in full:
The facts are true, the news is fake.

Which is exactly what is being observed in Bangladesh right now.",-1,t1_e3nrjsm,2,1533616477.0
"Hah, mate, calm yourself. I’m bangladeshi. I don’t even live in the US. And I didn’t bring up Trump because ‘ohno he’s ‘murican’, but more so because he’s probably the only world leader who screams ‘fake news’ and disses media whenever there is any news about his corruption.
