Spotify is way more expensive than Deezer. Deezer was available in BD a few years ago.,3,t3_lu6yvx,0,1614513227.0

"I'm using spotify for 3 years now and this is awful for me cause I didn't get any ad while using without vpn. Once you signed up for spotify back then from a country or using vpn. You don't necessarily need vpn all the time except while signing up every 15 days or so. Then you get no ads, it's basically like using spotify premium without really paying for it. But now that they officially launched spotify in bd and doing business it's getting ads from bd companies and I'm observing this since early february when I started getting first bangla fb ads and I was like shit it's here lol.",2,t3_lu6yvx,0,1616077951.0

Yeah I know and I have a Spotify free account but the problem is whenever I try to listen a song it just play another random one and says I need premium to play any songs I want or i have to rely on the will of the AI. and that's why Spotify sucks. If you want it for free.,2,t1_gp75sll,2,1614571779.0

jokes on you I don‚Äôt even use facebook. It was a decent post there was no reason to discourage the OP you imbecile,2,t1_gp8kq2q,3,1614577817.0
"Its just not the way you react to a meme bro you sound like a 9 year old...tbh who wants to be the funniest but ends up being narcissist. 

If u have a point why the meme is unfunny thats ok...did the op declare that its the most funniest meme on internet...obviously not.... and its not possible bcs comedy is varies from people to people. Its obvoius that its not the funniest but definitely a funny meme....so by stating a obvious fact that u have seen more funny memes or less funny memes which everyone on internet has...u made a fool out of yourself....",1,t1_gpbjvds,3,1614621948.0
No you can search songs for free but when it comes listening them the AI just picks another song and forces me to listen or says me to get premium.,2,t1_gp9l0f2,4,1614572268.0
