"i hear ya. also people are so anxious and worried that they become prone to missing out a few information unintentionally. sadly situation in Bangladesh has been so dire that what i said about the current administration wasn't too far off in reality, they have been running the country like a mafia except mafias tend to have moral codes which honourable sk. hasina and her cabinet do not possess. so i understand. pakistanis raped us and murdered us in 71, they targeted students and intellectuals during the WOI. history is being repeated, this time not by any alien nation-  it's chatra league.",7,t1_e3mow2d,5,1533456399.0

If you're in Dhaka, stay safe brother. And if you're in Dhanmondi, keep a frying pan handy. This government forgot what ""Shadhinotar chetona"" stands for and who fought in '71. Our students pulled through tougher shit before.
