long ago the 8 kingdoms lived in peace them everything changed when rajshahi attacked,31,t3_ly7t24,0,1614936461.0
" Went for a Japanese prefecture style for them.  
Khulna Flag : A sylized version of the letter Kha  
Rajshahi Flag : A stylized version of the Ra  
Sylhet Flag: Flowers, since it is a beautiful forested place  
Rangpur Flag: A monument, with a sun in the back  
Mymensingh Flag: White - feathers, Red and purple - colours of the Garo people  
Dhaka Flag: The water lily, an important symbol in Dhaka  
Chittagong Flag: The forested Chittagong hills (green), the sun and the moon  
Barisal Flag: A stylized version of the letter Ba   


I'm from Kerala, and Im not familiar with Bangladeshi culture (though it remains my favorite nation, along with the Philippines), feel free to correct me if some of these flags seem offensive or if you consider it cultural appropriation.

THIS IS SOOOO COOL THIS LOOKS LIKE AN AVATAR THE AIRBENDER-ESQUE KINGDOM FLAGS FOR OUR DIVISIONS OMG,18,t3_ly7t24,0,1614936428.0
"Nice concept, man...really appreciate this. But it would've been better if you could use some stylized version of symbolic things for each region. For example,  abstract of a mango for Rajshahi, may be. Though i am not sure how it would look, i have no sense of creating art, you better know.",6,t3_ly7t24,0,1614937658.0

"Can you Please describe what is the structural idea you put in individual flag. Like : culture, language, occupation what?",3,t3_ly7t24,0,1614948220.0
"Regarding the fact that you have little knowledge about the culture of these different places in Bangladesh, you actually created a decent flag conception about these places. Gotta admit that for sure. But there are some minor flaws which could be improved. Anyways great work bud!üòÉ",3,t3_ly7t24,0,1614953472.0

"Only the PM, ruler of all 8 kingdoms could stop them but when the country needed her the most. She joined them. Bringing the other kingdoms down to her feet. Corrupting them, eating them alive from the inside",28,t1_gpr8wxx,1,1614937273.0
Yes and then the central power had to bomb down the jamuna bridge to slow down their advance.,11,t1_gpr8wxx,1,1614937413.0
Its done nicely man! A very good concept and a sound executionüòÖ‚úåÔ∏è,9,t1_gpr6rs3,1,1614935803.0
"Well done in terms of color combination and design.

It is strongly visible you are not much aware of the districts culture. For instance, stylized version of Ra just because Rajshahi starts with Ra sounds is ridiculous. 

Gotta admit you got good skills. Keep it up.",3,t1_gpr6rs3,1,1614936548.0

"Yeah lol, tried searching up for the cultures and tribes of the regions but nothing comes up other than images of backwaters",6,t1_gpr90gx,2,1614939611.0
"Its mostly because of how progressive the nation is, for a conservative one ofc. Here in India, people kill men for going to mosques or for marrying a muslim, while Bangladesh which is also heavily influenced by conservatives managed to lower religious tensions, co-operate with 2 nuclear armed superpowers without choosing sides, lift millions off poverty and even outpace India in economic growth despite being the poorer nation initially.",2,t1_gpweuy6,2,1615173425.0
