">We need Pan Asian harmony.

No such thing ever existed. The word Asia itself is a Greek term for Anatolia and anything to the east of it. Armenia, Sri Lanka, Japan and Turkmenistan are all ""Asian"" yet have almost nothing in common with each other.

Indians don’t really treat Pakistanis as outsiders. They rather insult them saying they are pathetic convert or such type of BS. So basically it’s difference of religion. Mlecha is something they call mughals and british,12,t1_gt12afy,3,1617284411.0

Completely unrealistic at the present moment. Every nation in the subcontinent dislikes each other, including even Nepal and Sri Lanka, and I am not even going to go into the sectarian divides whether religious, ethnic or otherwise in India or Pakistan.
