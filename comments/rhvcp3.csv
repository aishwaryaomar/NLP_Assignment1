"Probably in denial but in general India did fuck Pakistan and bangladesh at that time, tbh as a Pakistani I am glad Bangladesh got independence otherwise because there were 2 official Launguages at the time of East and West Pakistan. If this East and west Pakistan theme countinued, i think there would be racism concerns over which launguage was better. So Bangladesh as a seprate muslim nation with its own identity is much better than the latter. Not ignore that Bangladesh GDP is much Higher than Pak.",8,t1_hov104i,1,1639762663.0

"Easy to shit-talk each other online. Takes guts to go to another country and sacrifice your life for the freedom of others. Actions define relations b/w 2 countries not the verbal non-sense. India-Bangladesh relations were formed in blood. As long as people remember the history while working for a better future, relations will be stable.
