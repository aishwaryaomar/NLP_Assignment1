"It‚Äôs really funny, that our Bangladesh government is taking credit for her hard work, her news and achievement are in all the channels in Bangladesh right now.  Shame on the government, not only they don‚Äôt do anything help normal people to develop their skills, don‚Äôt create any platform free from corruption.  But they will take any credit a single individual has earned by his or her own personal effort, which includes going through the corruption hardship the Govt has set at every stage. Not only this chef, but they repeatedly does it with anyone iconic. Seen too many times in the recent past.  

And lot of people in this page r questioning her nationality.  Why care whats her true nationality? As long as she identifies herself as a Bangladeshi, and cooking Bangladeshi food at such an important cooking show, she has done more for Bangladesh‚Äôs image then millions of us can ever do.  So let‚Äôs give her the credit and appreciation that she is so clearly deserves !!! She is a patriot",27,t3_oj1tes,0,1626163250.0
"Can't believe people are after Bangladeshis supporting her. Who cares about her nationality? I would've been supporting her if she was some white Aussie too. She has appreciation for my heritage, and makes beautiful foods with my country's cuisine, so of course I'm going to be happy about it! Her identifying strongly with her Bengali heritage is another plus point and people being salty about us praising her really need to get a life. Being born in a Western country doesn't mean you have to discard your parent's culture and heritage",30,t3_oj1tes,0,1626151365.0

"That is the boldest move anyone could pull. üíØ this is gonna cost her the title, but she is going down as a legend in history for this move! 

In the final no one cares about heritage and looks that much but the taste have to be at peak. And even though this food have thousand of year tradition, it  will not be tasty enough to make it through the finals. You can enhance the flavor for a certain dish only to a certain point. 

This is her legacy and  the 200 million of us couldn't be prouder!",10,t3_oj1tes,0,1626158522.0

"I work in the fish farming industry.  At the most remote village areas of Bangladesh.  We get no help from the government as farmers , even after all the help Government announced in the media we r gonna get, specially during the covid time. 

Now I don‚Äôt mind that.  But anytime  a farmer makes a profit , the media comes and tells how the farmer became so successful due to government‚Äôs help. When we know they didn‚Äôt do shit.  

Now I know at this event the government didn‚Äôt take any direct credit, but we all know they control the media.   Yes, on one hand her success should be celebrated , but on the other hand , the way the government is showing it , it‚Äô send a wrong message to others including international media , that all Bangladeshi‚Äôs are like her, when we are not.  That‚Äôs how I see government taking credit.  
I do appreciate your question and the respectful way you asked it.  I hope I was respectful in my answer. But if I made any mistake and u feel any disrespect , I apologize in advance.",10,t1_h50pau2,2,1626171014.0

"I guess you are right. But to be honest with you, it goes just as a far as the food and the fun. People from other nationalities

The reason I don't think this young lady should be THIS celerated in BD because for one:

1. She is Australian, not Bangladeshi. Yes she might be ethnically, but I can promise you she won't bring about any usefulness to the country
2. It gives the government a scapegoat to not better their own country. As in, by holding to the very thin thread that is her ethnicity, they try to sort of implying that her achievements are shared by them. It allows them to ignore the many geniuses, chefs, scientists, and literary masters in BD currently. If I can give an example, a girl here, London, has invented a disinfectant liquid that once sprayed on any hard surface it will make the surface covid proof for 14 days. Ain't that amazing? Well, she was all over the news in BD. When she was interviewed later by a Bangladeshi host in BD, he asked her ""You are Bangladeshi, when are you sending this stuff to us?"". She replied with ""I will focus on getting my country back in shape frist"", then he said ""your country?"". Then she said, ""Yeah, I'm British, I will get my country well before anything else."" He acted so shocked and she was very confused. This girl is 4th gen, British, the hell did he expect? The UK gov gave her a HUGE endowment and salary to produce her product, why should she not be thankful? Why would she supply her product for free to a country that didn't know she existed a week ago?

When we celebrated her achievements it was because it would benefit US. When we celebrated the achievements of the 17 year old chemist who found a way to mold copper and crystal, it was again because it would benefit us. We are ethically Bangladeshi, but I say this out of love, focus on your country. We aren't gonna help. I know it is a hard pill to swallow, but it's reality.

We don't identify with people in Bangladeshi so rightfully, you shouldn't do the same. 

I know this comment is silly given this is a cooking show, but it becomes more serious when it comes to medical discoveries.

I know how to cook Bengali meals, and I LOVE IT. But I'm not gonna fight for Bangladesh.

Just felt like this needed to be said.",1,t1_h5054zy,2,1626191577.0

"Well I‚Äôm not a Bangladeshi citizen and I think your opinion is rather generalised. Kishwar has been very open about her Bangladeshi-Australian identity. Her parents literally created a community Center to keep the heritage alive. And this is common in other countries too. 

Kishwar is a particular individual who has time after time unapologetically shown off her Bengali heritage. Food aside, she wore a Selwar Kameez to almost all if not every single day in the Masterchef kitchen and if you follow her on social media you‚Äôd be aware that she has been very much appreciative of the immense support she has received from the Bangladeshi community. 

You may not strongly identify with the Bangladeshi identity but it is evident Kishwar does, like me and many other Bengalis who don‚Äôt have a Bangladeshi passport, and if she didn‚Äôt no one would really support her

And your analogical comparison is rather silly but I‚Äôll leave you with your opinion. But you don‚Äôt have to speak for others, because like Kishwar and me, we do strongly identify with Bangladeshi people",0,t1_h51rgv5,3,1626279589.0

"Additionally it‚Äôs not a hard pill to swallow that you don‚Äôt contribute to Bangladesh and have no intention of doing so. Bangladesh isn‚Äôt petty for ethnically Bengali foreigners trying to improve our image of a third world ‚Äòpoor‚Äô country, BD has had a fair share of criticism from foreign nationals of Bangladeshi ethnicity, most of them don‚Äôt care though. 

But again to each and their own. I want to contribute and I will. Kishwar chose to contribute. Like kishwar hopefully someday, I will too. And there‚Äôs no reason to be salty about thag",1,t1_h563qwl,4,1626280101.0

"Comparing a cooking show to a medical discovery, and yourself to Kishwar without studying on what she identifies as. As I‚Äôve mentioned, anyone who follows her social media knows she is proudly Bangladeshi. So your argument is rather unreasonable",1,t1_h564929,5,1626332432.0
