">let's not even start to talk about your economy.

Even during the COVID outbreak, our nation had one of the strongest growth rates. In terms of GDP per capita, we surpass Pakistan and India. Not to mention that a genocide committed by Pakistan cost Bangladesh its intellectual heritage and 3 million people. When we first gained our independence, we were called a basket cage. Today, we are one of the economies that are rapidly developing. Yes, there is poverty, but we are and will continue to move forward.

"\> When you are on a rock bottom it's easy to have a fast growth 

rock bottom? Yeah buddy, we have been in political turmoil for nearly 38 years after independence in 1971 with all of our brainpower effectively killed off just 2 days before war ended, plus famines in 70s which killed nearly 1.5 million and even after all of that, our country just stabilized in early 2010s and since then we have grown consistently in economy (little fact : we tripled our economy within a decade XD), established world class RMG industry just second to China.

We are considered one of the NEXT Eleven countries which are expected to play large roles in 21st century as well expected to become one of the top 25 economies by 2030, considered as the next Asian Tiger, became an emerging middle power country in Indo-Pacific region that every big power is trying to woo.

Well, it is in a poorer half of Europe, not necessarily one of the poorest, there are plently that are quite poorer. Good luck to you to become a country where ordinary people can live well. In Croatia that is the case. The average salary of 1000 dollars isn't great but it's solid enough.

"Our population growth rate is 1.9. Our Birth rate is already lower than that of the US.

Don’t talk about things you have absolutely no knowledge of. 

Our high population is due to 2 things:

1. Largest Delta in the world

2. Rice

Places where rice is the staple food always have huge populations because rice is easy to cultivate, lasts a long while, takes little to be full. Couple that with us being the langest delta thus being the most cultivatable place on earth. You get the point.

Holland is the largest delta in Europe, guess which is the most densely populated country in Europe? 'nuff said.

This is the reason our population was so high even a thousand years ago. In the middle ages Gauda was the 3rd most populous city in the world and one of the most prosperous. We experienced a huge birth rate post ww2 - but so did most countries, it was due to the innovation of modern medicine, we already had a sizable population so it’s obvious that ours was so exponential. 

Throughout history this region was always prosperous, we had 12% world GDP in the 18th century. That changed after the brits came of course.

">racist agenda

Ahhh yes, it's always racism.

The fact is that you are a very young nation (average age 27 years). Your growth rate is 1% and of the USA is 0.13%. You have 2 million more births over deaths. In the USA the live birth is almost equal to the death rate. LOL you compare yourself to America - a country literally 60x the size.

Also, you as a nation now live longer and longer (which is a great thing), but this also means that you'll reach 200 million in just 30 years. Good luck living in rather a small country with the population of 2.5 Germanys. And it has nothing to do with your race. I would never live in the Netherlands or any similar country. But even the Netherlands seems like a paradise compared to you.",1,t1_j1986im,8,1671735880.0
">Ahhh yes, it's always racism.

What else honestly? I honestly don't understand what other reasoning would you have to come to another country's subreddit and peddle how shit they are. If it's to make fun of our football culture, so be it. Our football culture was huge in the 90's and 80's but due to lack of infrastructure and extreme corruption our local league is shit. People just *casually* follow countries similar to how many people follow club teams. 

>The fact is that you are a very young nation (average age 27 years). Your growth rate is 1% and of the USA is 0.13%. You have 2 million more births over deaths. In the USA the live birth is almost equal to the death rate. LOL you compare yourself to America - a country literally 60x the size.

Nice strawman, I compared ourselves to US with only *one* sector and because of the fact I have stated above. Also population growth rate is not an issue anymore for us. The current TFR of Bangladesh is 1.9, which is already at replacement level, and the growth rate is decreasing year by year. If you really want to poke your nose into population issues, do that with Pakistan, who have a TFR of 3.17 or Nigeria, with 5.

Also we have enough land to fit over 200 Million people if the day comes, but the fact of the matter is population would be decline after that anyway going by the current trajectory.

In 1971 our country was called a ""Basket Case"" by Henry K*ssinger, with no natural resources, high population density - it seemed that way. But we have defied all odds, and have progressed astronomically in the last 30 years alone. We have arrived at an era where we are better in all aspects than the country we got independence from. We have also been named among the ""Next 11"" by numerous organizations.
