"On the 29th of July, two bus drivers were racing to pick up passengers and killed two students who were waiting for a bus. Since then, high school and college students took to the streets and have been protesting peacefully against dangerous road conditions (i.e. no driving and traffic regulations and poor enforcement). They took it upon themselves to manage traffic (creating emergency lanes; arranging them according to vehicle size) and checking licenses of every passing vehicle (including police vehicles) on major roads. 

There are several students now dead and missing; all they did was demand safer roads in a country where people die from road accidents every single day. They took to the streets and checked licenses, regulated traffic, exposed an incredible number of people including government and ministry workers for driving without valid licenses. They had been doing a better job than traffic regulation and law enforcement officers in the city, and all they wanted was an assurance of safety.

This protest was entirely peaceful, wholesome and supported by most citizens. The government’s reaction to this was to send out student political parties to also don school uniforms and partake in the demonstrations. These “students” infiltrated the protests and initiated violence both on the students and public property, followed by law enforcement doing the same: opening fire and using anti-riot equipment such as tear gas, aimed at protesters who were 13-20 years old.

This event has gained traction on international media recently, and has been covered by multiple media outlets such as the New York Times and BBC. However, they’ve stated multiple times that the government claims these were instigated by the opposing party, while other parties have been trying to twist the narrative to fit their own agendas. However, that is NOT true. These are young students protesting PEACEFULLY against law-breakers and unsafe roads, they have no political affiliations whatsoever.

The government has also shut down mobile data in the country and slowed down internet speeds. They have been arresting and detaining people for posting things online that implied dissent, and multiple journalists have been attacked, detained and had their recording equipment seized and destroyed. The media was made to withdraw many of their previous statements and say their sources were wrong, and some hospitals are being pressured into turning away students who were injured at the protests. 

Today, Bangladesh is a battleground. These ""student politicians"" have turned the streets into a hunting ground, chasing down these peaceful protesters and brutalizing them. They're literally hunting anyone that looks like a student and murdering and mauling in the most inhuman ways... And these monsters are supported by the government. Law enforcement and these thugs (who are all armed beyond their pay grade) have murdered multiple people already, committed other crimes like rape and also attacking those trying to help the children.

"The same thing that had been happening for years all across the globe.

1. General population (en masse, not a few individuals) stops recognizing government as the legitimate authority - in general, or on some specific matter.

2. Status quo comes under threat. Examples need to be made.

3. Right-wing ""militia"" (as a rule, gangsters of some kind - though, sometimes some or all *are* on government's payroll) gets mobilized and responds with deliberately public terror tactics: beatings, tortures, rapes, murders, etc.

	Basically, you lose any and all rights as a human if you challenge status quo (or, if you *look* like challenging it, since nobody actually checks - there is quite a lot of violence done for other reasons, but framed as political). As a rule, police/judiciary will not even pretend that they care, though they might attempt to arrest and persecute those who resist this open terrorism.

	All of this is made painfully known to general population. All is presented as the new norm the society lives under.

4. Response gets hijacked by politicians, who try to keep resistance within ""politically correct"" boundaries until it loses momentum and everything can go back as it was before (only with more crime, corruption, and violence).

5. The rest of the world pretends that there was some kind of ""controversy"" and drowns out any discussions with meaningless jabber.",64,t3_94rgz9,0,1533481458.0

"Hello, I'm a Bangladeshi citizen living in Dhaka and a long time lurker, made an account so I could comment on the situation.

First of all, thank you for summarizing and highlighting the situation. However, there's some fake images, videos and descriptions are being heavily circulated which might lessen the impact of the actual things that are happening, specially in the world media.

Over the course of the last two days, the BCL members and other hired thugs attacked the student protesters and mercilessly beat them with steel rods, sticks and used machetes while the Dhaka Metropolitan Police either assisted them by hurling tear shells or stood around doing nothing. More than 150 students have been injured, some of them severely so, and most of them are getting treated in various hospitals. Again 20 to 25 journalists were   also brutally beat up by the same attackers. Students were also beaten up in the last few days. The editor(Who Is a woman) of a weekly magazine published by our nation's most widely circulated English Daily, The Daily Star, was beaten, dragged across the street and molested until she agreed to delete the footage featuring the BCL men committing atrocities. The condition here is truly horrible, but, a lot of people, specially on reddit are overstating various issues which might end up undermining the noble purpose and objective of the safe road protests.

For starters, while 3G and 4G internet services were shut down yesterday, they're back up now and most of the major and legit news outlets are reporting pretty much everything. And there's been no proof or validity of any of the rape and murder allegations that have surfaced so far. In fact, they've been disproved by trust-worthy news outlets such as The Daily Star and Dhaka Tribune. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not straight up saying they're untrue, and BCL members have been involved with many sexual assaults in the past, but none of the accounts in this case add up.A large number of female students are not missing and no dead bodies have been found on the spot where the clash occurred.

I'm only sincerely asking you to fact-check everything you're sharing. Because there truly are government sanctioned attacks being launched by BCL, and in our current situation, we can't hold the PM accountable, and she's resorted to the tactic of dismissing everything as rumours. If fake news clouds the legitimate reports then I fear this rhetoric of the government might work. There's things happening that are truly terrible enough to grab the attention of the international media. For example, the police and BCL members are practically pouncing on the students of a University right now. That's why, once again, I implore you as a Bangladeshi to only share and circulate things that are definitely true.",11,t1_e3n7pxd,1,1533547141.0

"> Right-wing ""militia"" (as a rule, gangsters of some kind - though, sometimes some or all are on government's payroll) 

Addendum: this is not a right-wing trait. It's an authoritarian trait. 

I'm just learning of the situation in Bangladesh and it honestly hurts how much it sounds like the June Journeys protests of 2013 in Brazil, protests I attended and have had friends hospitalized, beaten or arrested over. 

The chain of events was the same as you and the current top comment describe (including and especially the part about the ""student politicians"" on party payroll who infiltrate schools and student movements, which hurts a lot to see), except then (and now, though they're no longer in power) the militias infiltrating protests to start fights and vandalize property destroying the peaceful movement, as well as the brutal police that was ordered to escalate the violence and delegitimize the demands were all commanded by the *left*, the then ruling Labor Party and its allied base, consisting mostly of all the communist and socialist-leaning parties.

I'm not saying if the right rises to power things will be better or different, on the contrary the Brazilian conservative right scares me shitless, but for the same reason the conservative left does. 

So what I'm doing here is urging you and everyone else not to bring idealism into this and see it for what it is: **authoritarianism always hurts the people.** Left or right. 

I will read and learn more about the situation in Bangladesh before I form a proper opinion, but regardless it is my firm belief that power must rest in the hands of the people, and any government who will use force against its own citizens should not be. I do not think our Journeys of June were for nothing, they're an event Brazilian millennials and post-millennials imprinted firmly in our history and that will remain forever, and those troubled times have changed the course of history for my country. We're still undergoing the subsequent crisis, but the hope has remained, and Brazilians have seen that we can and should stand up against the corrupt rulers, and we made them see that too. I hope with all my strength that the same can happen in Bangladesh, and that your people can rise beyond the turmoil and enact change.

As I mentioned already, there are plenty of examples of private individuals (i.e. unaffiliated with state) participating in violence. Hence, any attempts to simply disempower state - i.e. act upon ""authoritarian understanding"", which implies reducing state power - will inevitably backfire: you are not removing the source of the problem. It's not about state.

> So what I'm doing here is urging you and everyone else not to bring idealism into this and see it for what it is: authoritarianism always hurts the people. Left or right.

In the same year (2013), Ukraine attempted to do exactly what you preach here. People rejected division between left and right, people had joined their forces against the ""authoritarian"" regime - and by 2014 they were victorious: state power disintegrated into nothingness, police troops were publicly beaten and shamed, ""authoritarianism"" was done away with in the most conclusive manner.

Except when you had people being beaten by policemen, you got public mass-murders - Odessa massacre alone had over 40 people dead, and even more died later (not only many were horribly burned and badly wounded from beatings, survivors were also denied basic healthcare). And after gangs of ""anti-authoritarian"" activists attempted to ""rape into submission"" whole regions, the result was low-key civil war with tens of thousands dying. 

The only ones who benefited were the very same corrupt state officials who were supposed to be deposed and the rich men who were milking Ukraine before.

Are you high, my friend? I'm not ""calling people communists"" as if it were some petty offense, I was literally referring to the actual Brazilian Communist Party (PC do B), the Socialism and Freedom Party (PSOL), the Worker's Cause Party (PCO), and so on, the Worker's Party allied base, you know, communists and socialists in the literal self-proclaimed and proud sense of the word.

> It is also a very different set of events, with ethnic and nationality considerations and heavy foreign interference, and really doesn't apply here at all.

No, it applies perfectly.

It was not about ""ethnic or nationality considerations"". Original protesters (pro-Maidan) did not present any ethnic/national demands. Their intent was to combat corruption and authoritarianism. That was it. Except they also embraced support of the rich (no reason not to, they are anti-authoritarian, after all) in their crusade and had their movement hijacked - which is how, once the old government had fallen, Maidan leaders redefined Maidan movement along more acceptable lines (which did not infringe upon their interests; nationalist, rather than economic) and most of corrupt officials stayed where they were before (with new and even more corrupt officials replacing those who got kicked out).

This pattern repeats in other situations, except nationalism gets replaced with other ""hot"" issues. For example, in Egypt (2011) it was religion. Hardly anyone would say that ""Revolution of Dignity"" (the same words Maidan propaganda used, btw) was about Islam, but it was the Muslim Brotherhood who ended up in charge.
