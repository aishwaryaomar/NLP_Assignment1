"This is a basic explanation one of my friends gave to me when I originally found out about this:   


""Thugs from one of the Bangladeshi cabinet members have gouged out the eyes of a student, killed a few more, and fifty missing students have just been found in an office building, all raped.

This is in retaliation to a protest about unsafe roads in which two students were earlier killed. The cabinet member is also the head of the bus industry there.""

So, basically corruption.",169,t1_e3mfeq4,1,1533432593.0
