"Its a shameful moment. Our govt and health sector is so corrupt, that we need someones grace to save lives. Its the govt duty to make sure everyone is taken care of. That we rely on peoples grace is sad. How much money is laundered? How Many dialysis machine would that buy? This is an attempt at eyewashing. Go ahead downvote me.

"Philanthropic and humanitarian efforts must be lauded. They are the signs of greatness. In the comments there are a few that talk about his post operative care failures. Well, in Bangladesh the clinics and hospitals lack equipment and sanitation and the general sense of sterility is low. Many operations face recovery crisis due to environmental lapses. I praise the man unconditionally. On the other hand the government is CORRUPT, INEFFICIENT, and OBLIVIOUS to public health, I deplore that.",1,t3_qj0s77,0,1635770311.0

"You're absolutely on point. But the sword cuts both ways. Specialised treatments are expensive everywhere. At least when you go up in quality. Look at USA. Their healthcare system is a total disaster. Even NHS in UK doesn't look very ideal.  And our government have focused on primary healthcare so much that specialised and emergency service is below standard here. Vaccination,low child and maternal mortality etc have been our achievements so far. It's time to shift focus on tertiary special and super special treatment centres. But affordability will always be an issue. No matter what you do, ""catastrophic medical expenditure"" will always remain a thing.",23,t1_hinagf1,1,1635607661.0

"True. Actually in US, your dialysis is taken care of by the govt. Look up john oliver episode called dialysis. And NHS compared to US is like BD comparing itself to Pak, Afg or India. 

The thing is, that i am sure there are hospitals which got allocation for the machines and either it was looted OR, the machine wasted away due to lack of expertise. The govt allocates money to keep their cronies happy. If some benefit happens, thats a side effect/unintended consequences.",4,t1_hinhv9c,2,1635607958.0

"Well secularists see the govt as their savior against islamism. However, this govt by it's anti democracy and human rights violations has made it so that huzurs are the only organized opposition left. A lot of people want change, by any means necessary.

"Patients who were treated by him. You can check Bangladesh Kidney Patient Association, its a facebook group consisting the patients.

"What I'm trying to say is, medical tourism has become a thing in Bangladesh because of our subpar quality. But USA too ,with all its transparency and resources, is seeing a rise in medical tourism. Because they've taken treatments out of affordability of their citizens. Dialysis is only one aspect. There are gazillion things wrong about their system. Transparency or resource will only work if the policy is fit for us. Balance between affordability and quality is what we need to find.",6,t1_hinijfv,3,1635611876.0

If the body rejects the organ, your transplant will fail even with best surgeons and best setup. No negligence needed. All patients are counselled about it before the surgery.

"HAHAHAHA. Bloody laymen talking bullsh*t they think they know sh-t about. Nephrologists are medicine doctors, not surgeons, you idiots. Kidney procedures are done by **urologists**. Dr. Islam is a fellowship trained urologist who is a gold medalist with an MS on urology from BSMMU and is also an FRCS Edinburgh. Dr. Islam did general surgery FCPS long time ago and then super specialized at urology later on, which I already explained. The post says the success rate is 96%, and I don’t think any surgeon in this critical field has a 100% success rate. If they do, kudos, but surgery = risk.
