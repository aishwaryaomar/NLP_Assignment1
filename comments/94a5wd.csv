"BCL, BSL are taking away cameras from spectators and news reporters. can we get a drone camera there? in jigatola?",108,t3_94a5wd,0,1533390080.0
"It looks like people are using their real names to upload photos, which is dangerous. There are a lot of other ways you can be identified, as well. Any device connecting to the internet has an ""IP address"" that websites can (and almost always) record, **and show your physical location**. (As specific as a ~~neighborhood~~ city block!) Further, your internet provider knows every website you use. Corrupt governments can and will find dissidents this way. Complete safety is impossible, but there are tools the minimize *some* risks. I don't know what kinds of devices people are using, but I'll try to cover the most common operating systems.

My **NON-EXPERT** advice:

The Tor browser is a great, free tool, for just this purpose. If you can't use Tor, there's the ProtonVPN program for Windows and MacOS, which you can use with any browser. It's a little harder to use on phones, because it doesn't have native apps yet, while Tor is available on Android ([Orbot plus Orfox](https://guardianproject.info/releases/)) but not iOS. ProtonVPN has a free tier, which is slow but secure - don't trust any VPN that has no paid tiers. Tor and VPNs encrypt information leaving your computer and pass it through one or more servers around the world, so that websites don't know what device you're browsing from, and the internet company doesn't know what website you're using. For the Tor Browser, use the ""[Bridges](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en)"" mode, so that you won't be identified as a TOR user. For VPNs, be sure to turn the ""start with [OS],"" ""auto connect,"" and ""kill switch"" options on, to minimize risk of accidentally exposing yourself.

One good things about the Tor Browser is that it can be run off of a flash drive, so you can use any computer. It's also standardized and has security settings defaulted so that it's more difficult to ""fingerprint."" If using a VPN, I recommend a new browser and settings/extensions shown [here](https://operational-security.com/3dsc-2-8-adjust-firefox-settings-security/) and [here](https://operational-security.com/firefox-security-privacy-add-ons/), to limit history/cookie collection, in case your computer is taken by police.

Only log into one service at a time, so that you can't be identified by cookies or cross-referencing accounts accessed. If using a VPN and a browser with container tabs, use container tabs if you need to log into multiple services simultaneously. Use a different username (unrelated to your identity/interests/biography - it can even be random, like mine) for each service (a password manager helps with this - keepass is free and there are versions for all operating systems), and don't give any real information when creating an account.

[Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) is a privacy-respecting email service that you can sign up for with just a username and password, though you can't send or receive emails for 48 hours, if you trip their spam detection algorithm. [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) is a better email provider overall, but requires sms or email confirmation that you're a real person, which would be a problem if your text messages or emails are already being spied on and you can't create a Tutanota account or use an internet based phone number.

Many news organizations use a tool called Secure Drop for uploading things. I don't know much about it, but by all means, use it - it's probably one of the best things you can do, **especially if you have photographs or videos that identify perpetrators of violence**. Thank you to the brave people who brought the protests to out attention, but please go to journalists first, not social media. Tell them everything you can in both English and Bengali - the basic information in English will let them work quickly and they'll find a translator to get the details from the Bengali. Links to news organization tips pages at the bottom - they all have instructions.

For communication within protest groups, ProtonMail is the best encrypted email and [Wire](https://wire.com/) is the best encrypted chat app. [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) uses phone numbers as usernames, which makes networking easier but may identify you. [Sudo](https://sudoapp.com/) (iOS only) gives you nine internet-based phone numbers and email addresses, which would be very difficult for the government to identify. Communication within the Sudo network is encrypted, but a few people downloading it and using the phone numbers and email addresses to create ProtonMail or Wire accounts for other protesters is perhaps a better use, since it's only for iOS. You can get three more identities per device with MySudo (the company is transitioning), but that app comes with very little call time.

Do **NOT** use WhatsApp. Backups aren't encrypted and are on by default and it's owned by facebook, has poor account security and a history of cooperating with oppressive regimes. A lot of news organizations offer to communicate through WhatsApp, but I think that that's because it's popular, not because it's good.

Metadata - sender/recipient and subject lines - isn't usually encrypted within apps, only the messages themselves, so a VPN is important. **Networks can be brought down by identifying who's messaging whom, even if the messages are unreadable**. This is usually done a more powerful government over a long period of time, but know that metadata is powerful - the US kills terrorists based on metadata. Journalists should be removing metadata (type of camera/phone, time, possibly location, etc.) from photos they use, but do it yourself before uploading them, anyway. You should be able to do so from your computer's file browser by right clicking properties>security or the equivalent.

If you need to secure photos/video to share with journalists later, email them to yourself rather than uploading them to social media. Even if they're not cooperating with the government, social media sites can and will delete violent content, just as a matter of policy. **Evidence of war crimes has been lost this way.** For larger files, sync.com is a cloud storage site with 5 gb free that is *probably* safe, but hasn't been audited for security like Tutanota, ProtonMail, Signal, and Wire and isn't old enough to have a track record. They don't ask for much information, and you should be connecting through Tor of a VPN, so there shouldn't be much that could go wrong with sync, anyway. You can use encrypted zip files both for an added layer of security and to reduce upload/download times, though you would need to either skip the encryption or communicate a password when sending the files, of course.

I think all smartphones have full disc encryption as an option in the security settings. Use it, along with a [long passcode](https://operational-security.com/ios-full-disk-encryption/), if you have a smartphone. Disable location tracking and turn it off, whenever you don't need it on and are at a protest. If a police officer takes your phone while it's unlocked, they'll still get everything, but if you're arrested with it locked, it'll be potentially impossible for them to get inside, without you unlocking it. (That said, they could threaten/torture you; you may just be delaying the inevitable.) Computers can be more difficult. It would be easier to use Bleachbit or CCleaner to overwrite anything sensitive immediately after it's been uploaded to the cloud/journalists.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a [Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/) guide with more information. [Motherboard.Vice.com](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a37m4g/the-motherboard-guide-to-avoiding-state-surveillance-privacy-guide), as well. [The Paranoid's Bible](https://paranoidsbible.tumblr.com/post/160173700334/the-paranoids-bible-20) wasn't written with this in mind, but is also good.

ProtonMail uses the same PGP encryption that the EFF recommends, and, [as of last week](https://protonmail.com/blog/address-verification-pgp-support/), can work with out-of-network PGP tools. You also access it completely through an internet browser, so your emails are on a server in Switzerland, rather than your hard drive. Fewer potential points of failure, and you don't need to download anything to your computer for police to find. To send a PGP encrypted email from ProtonMail to a newspaper or journalist, add them to your contacts; [there will be an option to upload their public key](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/how-to-use-pgp/). With other PGP tools, you either need to install a browser extension and link it to your email account or download Thunderbird and link that, plus a plugin - I think this is a big improvement.

Good luck, everyone! Again, I'm not an ""operational security"" expert, and even if I was, **nothing can eliminate risk in a situation like this**, but this is better than uploading to reddit with your real name, from your regular browser. /r/privacy will try to help you with any questions.

"There has not been a lot of news coverage here in America and I hope that we can all bring more awareness to what is currently occurring on the other side of the world. I compiled a list of what has happened and some links to more information. If anything is wrong just let me know and I’ll get to it when I can. This is by no means a complete list, just a broad overview of what is happening.

Currently, the Bangladesh government is trying to squash people's attempts to speak out against the violence that is occurring under the pretense of stopping ""fake news"" from spreading. To give you context of the situation at hand, two school bus drivers were recklessly racing one another to pick up passengers and led to the killing of two students. This resulted in public outrage and protest that was greatly fueled by comments made by Shajahan Khan, President of the Road Transport Federation. What started off as a peaceful, student movement against the killing of two students and road safety, has ended in bloodshed and violence. Several attacks are being made on students and journalists allegedly from the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), a corrupt youth organization linked to the Awami League.

I understand a lot of this is fairly recent and it's hard to pinpoint the truth in some of claims being made in the social media chaos that is ensuing, but the amount of evidence (photos, videos,articles) that is fitting the civilian’s narrative better than the governments is outstanding (see links below).

We cannot let a corrupt system take advantage over these people. We need to let as many people know the terrifying reality that is occurring right now. It is a warning to all of us of what can occur when the wrong people have too much power. As of now, the government has made attempts to cut off mobile internet, stop news outlets from reporting on the incidents, and change the narrative so it would fall in their favor.",15,t3_94a5wd,0,1533508487.0

I hate being silenced and having my voice muted. Their government is taking down media and posts that were supposed to spread the untarnished truth of their grim situation. This makes it more important than ever to speak out. A government that causes problems and subsequently hides those problems, is an inhumane government. Some might argue that sharing on social media or signing some petition would just be ineffective slacktivism. But it's that attitude that suppresses the message from reaching the attention of both the masses and the international authority. We need two things from the world: their undivided attention, and their undying support. The second part should be easy as what is shown is obviously and undeniably wrong. But we haven't finished the first step yet. And hitting that share button or that ""sign this petition"" button might do just that, if enough people do it.

"Is my understanding of the situation correct?

About a week ago students started protesting the government giving bus drivers licenses that didn’t deserve them, or were under age, therefore making the roads unsafe. The protest we’re sparked because two high school students were killed by buses. And then I believe four women were raped? And now protesters are being shot out with live rounds despite being peaceful/checking licenses. The Internet has also been shut off for most of the country. 

I’m trying to get the full story, but all of the news articles appear to be several days old and don’t include any of the police retaliation. 

Edit: I believe there was also a text message that went  out to everyone in the country stating that reports of killing/ rape were falsified and anyone spreading rumors should be reported to the government. ",8,t3_94a5wd,0,1533435570.0

*PARAPHRASED QUOTE:* ""Khan questioned why there was such an uproar over two children dying in Dhaka but no reaction to the 33 people killed in a bus crash in India the previous day. He was referring to the accident in Maharashtra's Raigad district, where a bus rolled down a deep gorge and killed nearly everyone on board.

What made matters worse was that he had 'smiles that would not go away', according to an article in the Dhaka Tribune.""

*TRANSLATION:* Reporter: Bro, which college are you from? \[College in Bangladesh refers to high-school.\] Victim: I was a student of Birshreshta Munshi Abdur Rouf School, but I graduated recently. R: That means you're a high school graduate right now? Okay, so where were you attacked? V: We were first attacked at Jigatola where 4 girls were directly raped. \[He repeats this several times, and the reporter asks him to confirm several times, as if in disbelief. R: Where are they now? V: They've disappeared. R: Okay, so we've heard that someone died right on the spot? V: \[nods\] We've received information that 4 people were shot and one of them- R: Were the police using rubber bullets? V: Not rubber bullets, live ammunition. Rubber bullets don't penetrate. They only leave bruises. R: Okay, what is BGB \[Bangladesh Border Guard, a law-enforcement agency\] doing there? What is their stance? V: BGB has closed its gates. R: BGB closed its gates? Okay, are the general students still protesting there? \[At Jigatola\] V: Yes, and the students are in front of Popular Hospital. \[A nearby clinic.\] And Chatro League \[the student wing of armed men responsible for these attacks\] is right on the other side. R: Where are the Chatro League members? V: Jigatola bus stand. R: They took up positions in Jigatola bus stand? V: On all sides. Chatro League has surrounded the place, leaving us stranded in the middle. R: Have you had any contact with any key leaders of Chatro League since the morning? V: They're good. They're probably sitting in an air-conditioned room, watching TV while students are dying and they're laughing at the whole thing. R: Okay so if you have indeed spoken to them- V: We've had no contact with them so far. R: So you've never even had any communication with them? They didn't stop even once, and instead started attacking you? V: They did not stop. They simply attacked. R: Did you manage to identify them? Like who is attacking, and where they're from? Did any media outlets reach out? Do you have an estimate on the number of injured students? V: Over ten. Over ten were injured and four were shot, one of whom died immediately. Four girls were raped. R: The four girls you claim were raped, are they students of your college as well? V: No, they're from Rifles College.

"You don't have to look at what triggered the event, but at the whole history of the country. The fact that the public transports there can run over people without any consequence -- which is already fucked up by itself -- is probably only one amongst many other issues they face.

A couple years ago a bunch of protests happened in Brazil against the Government's corruption and bad admnistration and what triggered the event was a raise of 20 cents in the bus money. Some people tried to demoralize the cause by saying things like ""it's just 20 cents"", but that overly simplistic explanation didn't take into account that it was like the 3rd ""small"" raise in a very short amount of time and that there were a lot of recent cases of corruption in all sectors. It wasn't only about 20 cents, but it was what triggered the event. Nowadays Brazil is much better and a lot of important politics were sent to the jail for corruption, including the highly popular ex-president.

3) People protest in demand for more strict traffic laws.

4) Minister in charge of transportation with known ties to POWERFUL CORRUPT TRANSPORT UNIONS makes insensitive remarks and brushes off the issue despite massive protest.

5) Public demands for his resignation.

6) Police start shooting rubber bullets and armed gangs show up beating and sometimes even murdering students with machetes.

It needs other countries to take notice. Report the truth. And use diplomatic channels to force a peaceful resolution. This is different than Russia and USA. And its getting more and more violent. ,3,t1_e3nt8kq,2,1533502588.0
"Is this how you react to many people being killed each day? Fuck off.

> Nothing of value was lost

LIVES WERE LOST! How do you like being killed?
Also, the ‘street shitters’ were racing for fun and killed people. Is that ok?
And also, if you care about Reddit being bad, leave. People are not going to stop doing this if you type some mean words. Reddit is just spreading the message.

So you are fine with outside sources interfering in governments as long as its your version of said outside interference. ",1,t1_e3nyo74,3,1533503181.0
" *Is this how you react to many people being killed each day? Fuck off.*   


Yes, this is how I react when people I don't give a fuck about die, millions of them died just as I typed this, not a tear was shed. Millions more will die before I go to sleep tonight, still don't give a shit.   


 *LIVES WERE LOST! How do you like being killed? Also, the ‘street shitters’ were racing for fun and killed people. Is that ok?*    


Yes, that is fine, street shitters got a problem street shitters may solve it, reddit can fuck right off out of the interventionist ""this is our crisis of the week everyone get involved"" bullshit.   


 *People are not going to stop doing this if you type some mean words. Reddit is just spreading the message.*   


Reddit is doing its usual think of hacktavist jump into a crisis then claim they are helping. They do it all the time, and frequently it leads to worse situations arising. They are hypocritic cock suckers, now fuck off.",-1,t1_e3nzrmq,3,1533503881.0
"I cannot even fathom how sad your life has to be to sit around on reddit convincing the world that you give a shit about people you never met, acting indignant about people you cant even name, and pretending like you have some sort of smug morale high ground in doing so, your absolute garbage fake ass sympathy doesn't make you a good person, it makes you a fucking emotional parasite.

"Of course. My version of said outside influence is diplomatic. As I said earlier. You know, things like reporting the truth as to what is going on by the international media, diplomatic talks between the leaders, etc. If saying the truth is interfering with the government, then maybe we must rethink the definition.",2,t1_e3nzarh,4,1533506311.0

"Truth hurts, that you are some sort of emotional parasite that lives vicariously threw the suffering of others, because your pathetic uninteresting life bores you to death. You use tragedy as something to draw attention to yourself, by feeling you can ""JUMP IN AND HELP BY RAISING AWARENESS"" as if awareness fucking means anything at all other then ""hey everybody, look at this person suffering! Don't you feel better about yourself now?""   


You are barely above a thief and far below a human. I am glad to be a nazi, at least I do not get off on pretending to give a fuck about others suffering. I leave the mourning and effort to those who actually care. ",0,t1_e3ogr4r,5,1533522426.0
